                  PANNM and worked through the project's original concept ideas,
                  drafting a skeleton of the work requirements and distributing
                  workloads. Nathan set up the team PANNM repository on GitHub,
                  and the remainder of the team were designated sections to

                  Australia. Team PANNM worked to differentiate our idea from
                  the others in the market place and elected to proceed with the

                  and the video presentation required to support it. Once
