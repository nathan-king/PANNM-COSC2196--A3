						<p>
							Our group formed during a tutorial session. Phil initially created the group and posted on the discussion forum about it.
							Then we were all in the same tutorial session when our tutor Umera suggested getting groups organised early. Since it was clear
							that each of us was active, we jumped into a group together. Completed well before the due date for Assignment 1, which meant
							 that we were well prepared when it came time to start working on Assignment 2. If not for a couple of minor setbacks, we could have started work immediately.
						</p>
						<p>
							We had two things that set us back to start with – the holiday period, and a missing group member. Assignment 1 was due just
							before Christmas, and usually, you might expect that work would begin on Assignment 2 immediately after. We didn’t have our
							first meeting until 05/01/2021, almost two weeks’ delay due to the holiday period. Another issue was the disappearance of one
							team member. We weren’t able to correctly assign responsibilities and workloads until our group was confirmed. After a period
							of non-response, the sixth group member was removed with the intervention of the course co-ordinator, and we were able to get down to business.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall all group members have been pleased with the work that we’ve contributed. Everyone approaches group work with trepidation,
							 and our team members were no exception. However, it is evident through our contributions that each group member is willing to
							 put in the effort and has a lot to share. Through constant communication, we have been able to get the most out of each team
							 member without overloading them and allowing other commitments in life.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each team member has their own set of skills which complemented each other brilliantly in this project. No company runs on
							just an IT department, so it was to our advantage that we have team members who are not pursuing specific IT degrees. With
							team members who have experience in management, financial planning, web design, sales and administration, we have created
							a project with views from a broad perspective.
						</p>
						<p>
							Overall we learned what many us suspected, or perhaps already knew, and that is it takes group members of differing skills
							and backgrounds to form an effective team. By offering our own experiences and opinions, we have produced a product more
							significant than what any one of us could. This learning can be carried over into professional life when forming teams, for
							 example, taking care to involve people from other departments when working on a project. With a diverse group, constant
							 communication is vital in ensuring that each team member is coping with their workload and has a clear idea of their
							 requirements at any given time.
						</p>
						<p>
						<h3>Phil</h3>
						</p>
						<p>
							I feel blessed with the group we formed, despite an initial hiccup with one member (no longer in our group) who failed to respond
							to all communication attempts. I feel everyone has got along together well. We had a diverse set of skills across the team that
							complemented each other. The group felt comfortable communicating with each other, especially with the Chat function in Teams.
							Together we worked well, supporting each other, agreeing on timelines and ensuring we were ready to move on to the next stage.
							Although everything has been relatively smooth, using some of the additional tools such as the Tasks list would help everyone quickly
							acknowledge the rest of the team when each task has been finalised. We discovered this late in the project, though used to track the
							final piece, the website completion.
						</p>
						<p>
							The one thing I have learned about working in groups, and more so from previous projects, is it is necessary to keep the communication
							flowing, checking in regularly. You need to understand what everyone has on their workload outside of the project. Not everyone may be
							as flexible as yourself and have other commitments hindering their ability to commit to a project as much as yourself. Understanding the
							pressure I feel working full-time, and completing this subject I have complete admiration for the rest of the team with both Alasdair
							and Nathan completing multiple subjects at a time (3) and Michelle nearly completing her degree, it is a big commitment to work with
							others and ensure the correct balance.
						</p>
						<p>
						<h3>Alasdair</h3>
						</p>
						<p>
							Our group worked well together, to the level that one might expect in a professional environment. Our group's overall maturity was on
							display, as each team member worked towards a common goal. I felt that no one team member was overly controlling, nor did we have anyone
							that was only willing to contribute the bare minimum. I have worked in several workplaces over the years, and rarely have I seen such a
							consistent, professional focus.
						</p>
						<p>
							I think that Phil’s leadership of the group has been essential to creating a final product that reflects the group's efforts as a whole.
							His style has never been dictatorial, but he has been mostly responsible for the doling out tasks. His ability to evenly distribute
							workloads across the team has meant that each team member has a chance to contribute, and nobody feels like they’re shouldering the
							burden for others. Each team member has also had the opportunity to showcase their strengths.
						</p>
						<p>
							I’ve learned from this that it’s essential when working a group that someone does take on the leadership role, a first among equals.
							My experience has found that work is a lot less efficient without someone willing to take control and responsibility as nobody has a
							clear role, focus and direction. That has not happened in this case.
						</p>
						<p>
						<h3>Nathan</h3>
						</p>
						<p>
							From the very beginning, this group has been cohesive and positive. I believe I can speak for the group when I say that I have never
							felt so motivated to work in a team. I was initially quite apprehensive about the group work because of the negative experiences I’ve
							had in the past, and the abundant anecdotes about the difficulties others have experience in these kinds of assessments.
						</p>
						<p>
							PANNM consists of five people from different backgrounds with somewhat different career goals. Nonetheless, I felt more cooperation,
							solidarity, and encouragement from this group than any other group that I have ever participated in. In our meetings, we were able to
							define and delegate pending tasks, schedule future tasks, and set deadlines that have, to the surprise of possible all of us, been respected to a tee.
						</p>
						<p>
							All in all, this group has enabled us to soldier through the workload with a smile on our face and a feeling of partnership and trust.
							I have been absolutely delighted by the experience and believe that the apprehension I had experience before starting this assignment,
							will no longer be carried into prospective work with future teams.
						</p>
						<h3>Nicholas</h3>
						</p>
						<p>
							When PANNM first formed, I was very concerned in the initial stage as there wasn’t a tremendous amount of contact within the group,
							it was around Christmas time, and everyone was having a much-needed break. However, my concerns were automatically laid to rest when
							the group made the first contact. Since then, the group has been consistently communicating on what must be daily while also juggling
							work, other classes and outside commitments. The group is quite diverse in our overall skill set, and I think we have done an
							outstanding job of playing to each of our strengths.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was quite surprised to see how open and helpful the group was during this assignment based on past experiences; group work tends
							to be quite challenging to navigate. I was glad to see that everyone was happy to step into a role and put in the hard work. The
							thing that I have learned the most from this assignment is to speak up and ask questions, mostly because my team members are all
							astute and I have never ventured into tertiary studies, so there was a lot of things that went over my head until I asked for help or clarification.
						</p>
						<p>
						<h3>Michelle</h3>
						</p>
						<p>
							I've never been a fan of group assignments in all honesty, especially when studying via distance education. I had always heard the
							stories of people slacking off and barely contributing and still getting the marks. As it has been made very clear throughout the
							assignments I have very little interest or understanding of IT, this was a concern when it came to joining a group as I feared people
							would not be willing to take me on. I have been thoroughly proven wrong, everyone in this group has been very accepting of one and
							another, and instead of feeling like a burden, I feel a part of a team and not afraid to speak out when I don't understand all the tech talk.
						</p>
						<p>
							PANNM works great together and has kept up a strong communication line throughout this process via the TEAMS app. If anyone struggled
							with deadlines or their workload, they made it known, for example, when I was sick one week and couldn't make the deadline I had initially
							been agreed too. I look forward to continuing with this group for the remainder of the study period.
						</p>
