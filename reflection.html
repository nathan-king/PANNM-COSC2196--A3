					<p>Our group formed during a tutorial session: Phil initially created the group and posted on the
						discussion forum about it, then we were all in the same tutorial session when our tutor Umera
						suggested getting groups organised early. Since it was clear that each of us was active, we
						jumped into a group together. Having had a good experience working together in Assignment 2, we
						decided to keep the group as is for Assignment 3 and not recruit to fill the extra slot.</p>
					<p>We were beset by minor illnesses throughout the assignment period, with all 4 of 5 group members
						being out of action at different times throughout. This did not seem to affect us however, as
						the group as a whole was happy to reschedule meeting times, and pick up the slack when one or
						two team members weren’t able to contribute. One thing we could perhaps have improved on was
						motivating those working to be able to meet deadlines, however we still performed well here.
						With the ability to record meetings, and with our agendas and actions being well maintained, it
						meant that nobody was left behind.</p>
					<p>It was surprising how much we all knuckled down and got straight into Assignment 3, without any
						perceptible break or introduction, and all group members have been pleased with the work that
						we’ve contributed. Everyone approaches group work with trepidation, and when initially forming
						our team was no exception. However, it is evident through our contributions that each group
						member is willing to put in the effort and has a lot to share. Through constant communication,
						we have been able to get the most out of each team member without overloading them and allowing
						other commitments in life.</p>
					<p>Each team member has their own set of skills which complemented each other brilliantly in this
						project. No company runs on just an IT department, so it was to our advantage that we have team
						members who are not pursuing specific IT degrees. With team members who have experience in
						management, financial planning, web design, sales and administration, we have created a project
						with views from a broad perspective.</p>
					<p>Overall, we learned what many of us suspected, or perhaps already knew, and that is it takes
						group members of differing skills and backgrounds to form an effective team. By offering our own
						experiences and opinions, we have produced a product more significant than any one of us could.
						This learning can be carried over into professional life when forming teams, for example, taking
						care to involve people from other departments when working on a project. With a diverse group,
						constant communication is vital in ensuring that each team member is coping with their workload
						and has a clear idea of their requirements at any given time.</p>
					
					<h3>Phil</h3>
					
					<p>
						Studying over the Christmas break always brings challenges for you to consider. Balancing time
						between family work and study is difficult enough at the best of times. We needed to get away
						for a week as a family after having to cancel our last three trips due to COVID lockdowns here
						in Victoria. Though between Christmas and week-long family vacation, the study took a toll and
						all of a sudden, I was four weeks behind.</p>
					<p>
						We then came together as a group of like-minded online uni students, different backgrounds and
						experiences, but we formed a group to become team PANNM. Surprisingly despite the challenges of
						working together remotely with Alasdair in Perth, Michelle and Nathan in Sydney while Nick and I
						reside in Melbourne, the geographical and time-based differences did not impede us from working
						together so surprisingly well. I have found in the past when working on group assignments that
						while you often will connect with one or two, it is rare for all five teams to get along so
						well. Though it does not come without its challenges, each having differing study styles and
						timing can make it difficult when waiting for pieces to finish, so the next part falls into
						place. The team's communication continued to be excellent and extremely helpful when each group
						became ill at different times. The one thing I feel we could work on is how to motivate each
						other, as with so much on everyone's schedule, it can be challenging to stay at the top of the
						to-do list.

					</p>
					
					<h3>Alasdair</h3>
					
					<p>
						Once more, our team worked well together, with the kind of professionalism and mutual effort
						that you see only in the more effective workplaces.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having all become accustomed to each other’s strengths and styles, it seemed like we all just
						got down to business and got on with it for this assignment. As opposed to the pure writing of
						the last assignment, this assignment included differing elements such as tangible artefacts
						(which we have delivered as an interactive prototype) as well as a video presentation. We did
						not require a lot of time to work out who was going to do what and when; while we did plan out
						what we were going to do and assign responsibilities, it all flowed easily and there was no
						protests.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’ve really enjoyed the enthusiasm and effort that each group member has shown. What it has
						taught me is that if you gather a group of different individuals together who are united in
						purpose and drive, you can produce something much more than any single one could have by
						themselves.
					</p>

					<h3>Nathan</h3>

					<p>
						Since the conception of PANNM, this group has been such a pleasure to work with. The group
						consists of unique people of various backgrounds, and it has been enlightening and motivating. I
						think that most of the parties within PANNM can agree that this has shed light on the best
						possibilities of group work and enabled us to explore this in a different light.
					</p>
					<p>
						Something that went especially well is the development of our concept. I really think that all
						of us were able to contribute a little bit of who we are into this process. I think the thing
						that could have been improved is the designation of roles from the very beginning. Something
						that was surprising was that we all had to create some entertaining videos as part of the
						assessment. Lastly, I learned that groups can be extremely motivating and somewhat difficult to
						manage.
					</p>
					<h3>Nicholas</h3>

					<p>
						PANNM has continued to be an incredible group to be a part of. From the start of the A3 period
						we have had constant communication with each other to ensure that we submit an assignment that
						is of the highest quality. I think we did a great job of playing to our strengths while also
						allowing for us to learn aspects of the industry that we are not as familiar with. We also did a
						much better job of using tools to help with our organisation and sticking to our timeframe.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was very surprised with how helpful everyone was. Any time there was something I had a bit of
						confusion with I knew that I could ask anyone for tips, and they would be more than happy to
						help me out. I have learnt during this process that I should put more effort into making my
						voice heard in group projects in the future. The only reason this group functioned so well was
						because everyone was comfortable stating their mind and sharing ideas.
					</p>

					<h3>Michelle</h3>

					<p>
						I feel beyond lucky to be a part of PANNM, to a point I hope my remaining subjects do not
						involve any group work as no other group could possibly meet the standards we have set. As I
						felt quite overwhelmed by assignment 3, I felt my severe lack of knowledge was obvious and I was
						concerned of what I could contribute. Again, we kept up the lines of communication as best we
						could via the TEAMs app, with scheduling and sickness causing some issues throughout the
						assignment period. Eventually we got the ball rolling on both assignment 3 and 5. We were able
						to focus on our areas of strength and assist with each other's weaknesses. I found the catchups
						to be very informative. I may not have been able to contribute much during these, but I learned
						a lot, especially from the guys with a background in IT. This gave me the confidence I was
						originally lacking to complete my sections, knowing I could always ask for help when needed. I
						have learnt that when you have a compatible group, a group assignment really isn't that
						daunting.
