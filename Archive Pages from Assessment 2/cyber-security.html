				<span class="image fit"><a href="citations#citations-cyber"><img src="images/Technologies Cyber Security.png" alt="" /></a></span>
				<h2 class="major">What does it do?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">Cybersecurity refers to methods that are used by Individuals and IT professionals to secure information and devices, keeping them protected against any attackers <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(TechRadar 2020)</a>. The main aim is to preserve the confidentiality of the information, so access is granted to authorised users while restricting access to anyone else to prevent data leaks and data misuse for malicious purposes.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Cyberattacks have been happening since the late 1980s. They have become a regular occurrence in the last two decades <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(Spanning, 2020)</a>, with more and more businesses storing information on local and cloud servers. As a result of data access being required globally, more people are aware of their internet presence and the necessary software to secure them. In turn, this has pushed hackers to become smarter in finding ways to catch people off guard and trick them into giving access to their systems. Therefore, most businesses use multiple security layers to ensure their systems are completely protected against all kinds of breaches and malware that can be accidentally downloaded from websites, spam emails and other forms of intrusion.</p>
				<p align = "justify">To ensure a system is entirely secured from breaches, an individual or business will often use any combination of the following highly recommended security forms to ensure that all fronts are covered.</p>
				<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
					<ul class="alt">
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Information Security</strong> works to directly secure files using encryption tools to ensure that even if an unauthorised user accesses a file, the information is all unreadable <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(TechRadar 2020)</a>. Information security is found in most sites and programs that store data on them.</li>
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Cloud Security</strong> is a security method on cloud servers that observes any activity and access to data in the account and will send out an alert when any suspicious behaviour occurs. Cloud computing is overall entirely private; however, security is recommended to ensure a high protection level <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(What Security? 2020)</a>. </li>
						<li = align = "justify"><strong>Network Security</strong> involves protecting your local network from external threats and intrusions. It is more likely to be required by an individual than cloud security as it allows for a user's home network to be protected against breaches. Network security can be broken up into the physical aspect such as physical access to network components like routers, Technical which includes the protection of data on the network, and administrative security which addresses user authentication, levels of access and password management <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(Forcepoint 2018)</a>. </li>
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Application 	Security</strong> is one of the more needed forms of security that is usually implemented by the software developer. It is especially needed as applications can prove to be quite vulnerable to attacks because they are accessible over different networks <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(What Security? 2020)</a>. Application security is a way of adding features to specific software to protect it from a range of attacks and data theft <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(Techopedia.com n.d)</a>. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p align = "justify">These security tools are implemented using different kinds of software, all of which have improved quality, price and accessibility over the years. Some of these applications offer a free version with limited features which is still enough for the average user. These forms of the software include:</p>
				<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
					<ul class="alt">
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Antivirus Software</strong> allows users to scan their system in search of any malware or try to enter the system that could be attempting to access and steal sensitive data <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(Lifewire 2019)</a>.</li>
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Firewalls</strong> manage the incoming network traffic and prevent any suspicious data packets based on set security rules. It works as a protective wall between the local network and any external sources <a href="citations#citations-cyber">("What Is a Firewall?" 2018)</a>.</li>
						<li = align = "justify"><strong>Encryption Programs</strong> are a security program that will work to encrypt a stream of data to ensure it is not accessible unless by an authorised user <a href="citations#citations-cyber">("What Is Encryption Software?" n.d)</a>. 	</li>
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Anti-Spyware</strong> is a software that will continuously search for spyware which has the primary goal of getting access to your computer to log any passwords and keystrokes made by the user. It will do this by scanning any new and existing applications on your hard drive <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(Financesonline.com 2017)</a>.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<h2 class="major">What is the likely impact?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">With a more considerable emphasis on the importance of Cybersecurity, good quality and secure software are highly sought out. There is a vast market for security software with very competitive prices and different programs offering their own individual features such as some antivirus platforms offering free Virtual Private Networks (VPN), and browser extensions so that a website can be vetted to verify that it meets the security requirements provided by the software.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Cybersecurity advancements allow technology to be implemented securely in more ways, such as through the Internet of things (IoT). Most people tend to not worry about IoT device security even though most of us have one in the form of a smartwatch, google home and even robot vacuum cleaners. These appliances are most vulnerable as they are also connected to WIFI networks to be controlled by our phones and therefore can be used as a back door into our private networks. This is where Cybersecurity should be used to allow these appliances to function correctly and securely. Having encryption set up on your private network is recommended. Ensure your passwords are strong enough to secure your network correctly and keep all device software up to date as updates can contain patches to security flaws <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(US.norton.com 2019)</a>.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Advancements in Cybersecurity have also allowed for greater digitisation of healthcare records such as in the Medicare my health record implementation which stores all health care records on a single database to be accessed by healthcare professionals. This system is not possible without the use of high-grade technology, data management controls and audit trails that record information such as the organisation accessing a record, when the record was accessed and the reason for accessing this information. This helps to maintain a log of any external threats that may have gained access to the system so that any data leaked can be accounted for <a href="citations#citations-cyber">(My Health Record 2018)</a>.</p>
				<h2 class="major">How will this affect you?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">Technology is a massive part of my life. I play games online, I study online and throughout 2020, like many other people I was encouraged to work online from home. It has only been this year, where I was forced to look at the digital footprint I am leaving online and consider how much of my data is accessible by external threats. I often re-used the same passwords, and I rarely performed scans on my system for malware. Still, since I was required to have access to my works database and email accounts that contained confidential information regarding insurance customers, I have been encouraged to increase my home computer's integrity. I am now back at work; however, I still have regularly scheduled scans for malware on my system and in emails, and I use a VPN for added privacy when browsing on my phone and computer.</p>
				<p align = "justify">My internet presence has become increasingly concerning for me as I enjoy having a high privacy level on the Internet. However, I know many other people, including some of my own family, do not see the risk posed by unprotected devices and out-of-date software. Overall, the risk of cyberattacks is rising, with an increased internet presence and is something that needs to be prevented.</p>
