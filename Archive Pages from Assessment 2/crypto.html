				<h1 class="major">Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.</h1>
				<span class="image fit"><a href="citations#citations-crypto"><img src="images/Technologies Blockchain.png" alt="" /></a></span>
				<h2 class="major">What does it do?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">A blockchain is an ever-growing list of records chained together, in a way that means if a previous entry in the list (i.e., link in the chain) is changed, it will change all subsequent entries. This allows for the decentralisation of the list, or ledger while verifying the correctness of the contents. The decentralisation of this is known as the distributed ledger system <a href="citations#citations-crypto">(Hussey 2019)</a>.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Invented to power Bitcoin, Blockchain runs using some powerful cryptographic algorithms, and 'the technology behind bitcoin lets people who do not know or trust each other build a dependable ledger' <a href="citations#citations-crypto">(The Economist 2015)</a>. The way it works to do this follows the following steps:</p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li align = "justify">A transaction is proposed between two users, user A paying user B</li>
						<li align = "justify">The Blockchain is checked to ensure that user A has sufficient currency for the transaction.</li>
						<li = align = "justify">A record of the transaction is encrypted then bundled with several other transactions, and these are merged and "hashed" (reducing their size using cryptographic techniques) to prepare a new, provisional "block".</li>
						<li align = "justify">The provisional block is given a mathematical puzzle involving this provisional block's data and the previous block's hash. This puzzle requires significant computational power to solve as it is calculated using trial and error. However, it is easily verified, e.g., It is much easier to confirm that 34 * 2 + 35 – 3 = 100 than it is to work out what the symbols are for 34? 2? 35? 3 = 100.</li>
						<li align = "justify">Once solved, the provisional block is added to the chain along with a timestamp and the solution.</li>
				</ol>
				<p align = "justify">The mathematical puzzle is the core of what makes cryptocurrency work. By controlling how difficult the mathematical puzzle is to solve, we can maintain the new blocks and the new currency. <a href="citations#citations-crypto">(Hong 2021)</a>. As any cryptocurrency such as bitcoin is used and matures, the Blockchain's size gets more extensive and can increase exponentially as take-up increases <a href="citations#citations-crypto">(De Best 2021)</a>.</p>
				<p align = "justify">State of the art technology in Blockchain sees it moving on from being used solely for cryptocurrency into other purposes where it is useful to track items or even regular currency. As it is decentralised, no single point of failure or designated third party is required to verify.</p>
				<p align = "justify">One use for a decentralised system is a concept known as smart contracts <a href="citations#citations-crypto">(Hussey 2021)</a>. A smart contract relies on a blockchain to verify and perform a transaction, instead of a third party. For example, if a customer purchases an item from a business using a credit card, a bank must be involved in the transaction. The bank will then check if the customer has sufficient money and then transfer the funds to the business – the weakness is that if the bank is unavailable for any reason, the transaction will fail. The bank is removed from the equation in a smart contract and checks performed on the Blockchain. Blockchain is held in many different locations, making it much harder to interrupt the transaction.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Another exciting upcoming use for Blockchain is its use on the Internet of things. The Internet of things is a modern concept meaning the network connectivity of "smart" devices, such as smart plugs and smart lights. With these devices' proliferation, existing internet infrastructure cannot handle the volume of small transactions that these devices can make <a href="citations#citations-crypto">(Hussey 2019b)</a>. By using Blockchain technology, the devices can, in a way, run themselves by needing to verify two other IoT transactions to make a third, known as an Internet of Things Application and is its own cryptocurrency.</p>
				<h2 class="major">What is the likely impact?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">Offering applications far beyond cryptocurrency, Blockchain has the potential to change record-keeping and trade in ways unprecedented.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Blockchain will enable much greater transparency in supply chains, which is a current issue globally <a href="citations#citations-crypto">(Blockchain Council 2019)</a>. One application is in pharmaceuticals, verifying that medication is the genuine article. It will be possible to track a particular batch of medicines from the point of purchase, back through dispensing and to original manufacture meaning greater accountability from all parts of the supply chain. With a lack of government infrastructure, third-world countries or those with no trusted central authority for pharmaceutical regulation and tracking will show the most significant impact with their decentralised nature. Similar measures can be employed in other industries prone to counterfeit, such as fashion and electronics. </p>
				<p align = "justify">The removal of a central authority for payment processing has the most potential to affect those who act as these central authorities, banks and credit providers. <a href="citations#citations-crypto">(Praveen Kumar 2020)</a> Banks are currently slow to react to this new technology's emergence – though some banks such as the People's Bank of China are experimenting, others are only performing perfunctory research and development. In the way, Uber changed the taxi industry, or Netflix changed video rentals, this disruption could be disastrous for the banks with loss of employment as banks too slow to react are left behind.</p>
				<p align = "justify">A negative result of Blockchain and cryptocurrency is the environmental impact of all this computing power. The amount of energy used to perform a bitcoin transaction is many orders of magnitude higher than a regular transaction <a href="citations#citations-crypto">(Digiconomist 2020)</a>.</p>
				<span class="image fit"><a href="citations#citations-crypto"><img src="images/Technologies Bit Coin Energy.png" alt="" /></a></span>
				<p alilgn = "justify">As seen in the above image, bitcoin and carbon footprint's energy consumption is more extensive than some countries. Given that bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency (though it is the largest), this suggests that the actual environmental impact is far more considerable and not sustainable.</p><br>
				<h2 class="major">How will this affect you?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">Currently, I have four cards in my wallet that identify me, and six cards that are used for performing transactions in some way (e.g., credit cards and public transport). Each of these relies on a single central authority to be verified if I try to use it. Each of these can be replaced by Blockchain, removing the reliance on the central authority. For example, when getting on a bus and tagging on using my Smartrider, if there is a communication issue between the bus and the central authority (Transperth), the Smartrider will not function. If records were instead maintained on a blockchain, even if there was a communication issue with Transperth the Smartrider would still perform. Similar could apply to each of the cards I carry in my wallet, increasing the reliability of the services I use.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Being able to track the source of items and their journey will help me know what I'm getting. Commonly restaurants claim they are serving Harvey beef, a particular brand of beef grown in a South-West WA town <a href="citations#citations-crypto">("Harvey Beef, West Australian Beef" 2015; "Settlers Tavern Main Menu AHA Awards of Excellence' Hall of Fame'” 2019)</a>. There is no way to verify this, other than to trust that some regulatory agency somewhere is doing their job. With Blockchain, it would be possible to trace the beef used in the restaurant back to the source and verify that I am eating the genuine article. This could be applied to other applications where the origin is important, such as my partner’s jewellery collection. With Blockchain there will never be a reason to unknowingly accept a counterfeit product.</p>
