				<span class="image fit"><a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/coref.shtml#:~:text=Coreference%20resolution%20is%20the%20task,question%20answering%2C%20and%20information%20extraction" target="_blank"><img src="images/Technologies Natural Language.png" alt="" /></a></span>
				<h2 class="major">What does it do?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">Natural language processing (NLP) attempts to reconcile the differences between human language representation and the computer instruction set in basic terms. In essence, NLP translates human language into a language understood by computers <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(Kyrill Poelmans 2020)</a>. On a broader note, NLP is a subdivision of artificial intelligence (AI), itself a subdivision of computer science, concerned with developing technologies that enable a computer to understand human language at a human-like level <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(IBM Cloud Education 2020)</a>. How NLP aims to do this is through tasks such as speech recognition, co-reference resolution, part-of-speech tagging, sentimental analysis, word-sense disambiguation, and natural language generation <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(IBM Cloud Education 2020)</a>:</p>
				<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
					<ul class="alt">
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Speech recognition</strong> is how computer analyses the spoken language data and represents it as human writing, considering factors such as grammar, syntax, product branding, the sanitisation of profanity, and even identifying and labelling the source of a speech segment <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(IBM Cloud Education 2020)</a>. An excellent example of speech recognition is YouTube's automatic captioning feature which generates words and phrases from the audio of videos.</li>
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Co-reference resolution</strong> is the identification of different words and expressions that point to the same individual or object. In an example given by the Standford NLP Group, the term "he" may refer to a man named "Nader," so being able to identify that the two words refer to the same entity is especially important in NLP <a href="citations#citations-nlp">("The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group" 2016)</a>.</li>
						<li = align = "justify"><strong>Part-of-speech tagging</strong> is the classification of words as serving a particular grammatical function. These grammatical functions are defined by as being a part of speech such, as a noun (an object or person), a verb (an action), an adverb (how an action is performed) etc. <a href="citations#citations-nlp">("The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group" 2017)</a>.</li>
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Sentimental analysis</strong> is the classification of sections of language as negative, neutral, or positive in sentiment. NLP achieves this by breaking down speech or text into components or phrases, assessing its sentimentality, and then devising a score evaluating the language section's general sentimentality. <a href="citations#citations-nlp">("Sentiment Analysis | Lexalytics" 2021)</a>.</li>
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Word-sense disambiguation</strong> understands how the meaning of a word or phrase can differ depending on its context—utilising resources such as dictionaries, artificial neural/connectionist networks, and statistics <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(Stevenson & Wilks 2012)</a> as programming languages are unlike human language which is mostly abstract and full of homophones, homonyms, idiomatic expressions etc.</li>
						<li align = "justify"><strong>Natural language generation</strong> takes a set of data, identifies patterns within the data, and then generates human-like and natural language <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(TechTarget Contributors 2017)</a>. Natural language generation generates news or allows a computer to interact with human beings (e.g., chatbots).</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p align = "justify">NLP has developed many well-known tools that we use today, such as spell-checking, autocomplete and spam-filtering <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(Kyrill Poelmans 2020)</a>. Furthermore, it has resulted in the development of chatbots.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Chatbots are artificial intelligence programs that attempt to utilise natural-sounding human language to converse with human beings in a human-like manner <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(Chatbot: What is a Chatbot? Why are Chatbots Important? - Expert.ai 2020)</a>. Chatbots take advantage of NLP to bring robots closer to human beings and allow human-computer communication that is mostly simplified and natural. </p>
				<p align = "justify">There are generally two forms of Chatbots. A task-oriented Chatbot used for queries about products from customers or Data-driven predictive Chatbots often seen as virtual assistants who aim to personalise themselves according to the user and adapt preferences over time, such as Cortana, Alexa etc. <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(What is a Chatbot? 2020)</a>. In summary, chatbots represent NLP principles' culmination and increasingly allow more human-like interactions between human beings and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
				<h2 class="major">What is the likely impact?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">There are numerous ways natural language processing will generally impact human beings and how they interact with technology. NLP features already impact our everyday life, with tools such as autocorrect, virtual assistants (such as chatbots), “Google Translate”, automatic video captioning etc. </p>
				<p align = "justify">Indeed, NLP is becoming more and more present in our lives and is a field that is growing exponentially. As NLP improves, so will the accuracy of its tasks. For example, the sentimental analysis will consider more of the unspoken aspects of human communication, such as facial expressions and body language. Furthermore, NLP will likely integrate Machine Learning more and more in developing robust and adaptable chatbots. The ubiquity of such innovations may create a market that comes to expect such technology as part of the consumer experience <a href="citations#citations-nlp">("The Future of NLP in Data Science "2018)</a>. </p>
				<p align = "justify">Some other future NLP applications are in healthcare, personal virtual assistants, and the automotive industry <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(Radhika Madhavan 2019.)</a> In healthcare, NLP could be utilised to improve medical imagery interpretation through captioning, assistance in the diagnostic process, and the generation of medical reports. NLP could enable more fluid and natural task giving by the user with personal virtual assistants, where a task would be split up into smaller commands. Lastly, in the automotive industry, NLP could be harnessed to bridge the gap between the breadth of functions that the AI system can perform and those that can be executed by other systems. Thus, if the command were made outside of the system's capabilities, this task would be delegated to another integrated system, such as opening a garage door <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(Radhika Madhavan 2019)</a>. </p>
				<h2 class="major">How will this affect you?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">On a personal level, NLP will change the way I interact with technology daily. As NLP improves, communicating with technology will be more and more like interacting with human beings. As I wish to become a programmer and software developer in the future, we will probably see the emergence of more human-like programming languages and paradigms. While I doubt that traditional programming languages will cease to exist, speech-to-text may make its way into development circles to deal with the problems associated with conventional typing.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) resulting in physiological problems that may preclude programmers from coding in traditional ways may benefit from improving NLP software in fields such as software development and scientific disciplines that use programming. While currently programming by voice may sound like a "staccato" of commands, I expect that more human ways of writing the code will emerge as NLP increases its robustness and accuracy <a href="citations#citations-nlp">(Nowogrodzki 2018)</a>. Furthermore, NLP in programming may allow for more fluid development and boost creativity through natural human expression.</p>
				<p align = "justify">As a consumer, I am already starting to see automation to make its footprint in the world. I believe that as NLP is ameliorated and perfected, we will begin to see automated interactions become more human-like. In that respect, I will probably be less likely to notice whether an online exchange, for example, is with a human being or a chatbot. </p>
				<p align = "justify">Furthermore, I will probably start to see more reasons to utilise personal assistants to become more ubiquitous and straightforward.  This will affect how I do shopping, make plans, interact with others and execute basic daily tasks. Whether as simple as turning on a light, writing a software application, or setting the GPS on a self-driving car, I expect NLP to have a large and lasting impact on how I live and interact with the world. </p>
