				<h4 class="major">What kind of work does he do?</h4>
				<p align = "justify">Our interviewee Alistair Elliot is a director for an IT consulting organisation, Discovery Consulting. Discovery Consulting specialises in SAP software, which is a type of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software <a href="citations#citations-work">“What does SAP stand for?” 2020)</a>. ERP is essentially the software that integrates all enterprise processes into one system, allowing for central management and integration of processes such as Finance, HR, production etc. <a href="citations#citations-work">(“What Is ERP Today?” 2020)</a>.</p>
				<p align = "justify">This means that Alistair works with his clients to develop IT solutions for their business that use SAP software. As a consultant, it is his role to get an idea of what his clients want and work collaboratively to create a solution. The end goal is his clients end up saving money and can work more freely.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Alistair finds it rewarding to plan and design systems that go beyond what the organisation has envisaged. He has had many cases where he has assisted organisations with vast amounts of manual work and processes, causing significant inefficiencies and some significant errors to occur – front page newsworthy. By implementing the system that he has designed along with his company, Alistair can demonstrate to his clients' tangible results and increased productivity. By allowing his clients to work faster and more accurately, Alistair finds job satisfaction.</p>

				<h4 class="major">Who does he interact with, and how?</h4>
				<p align = "justify">Working between a vendor and customers, Alistair is needed to interact with three groups of people: his customers, the software vendor, and internal company members. </p>

				<div style="margin-left: 3em;">
					<ul class="alt">
						<li><h4 class="major">Customers</h4>
							<p align = "justify">As with most businesses, customers are at the centre of what Discovery Consulting and Alistair do. As his customers are implicitly all businesses, his interactions with clients are of a B2B (business to business) nature.<br>
							ERP software will touch all parts of a business, so Alistair predominately deals with his customer’s organisations' executive level. Usually, this would include the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for outlining the strategic plans for IT systems, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for planning financial systems and budgeting, and Chief of Human Resources (CHR) for when solutions involve human resources.<br>
							Key to all his interactions with customers is collaboration. As a consultant, he is a bridge between what the client wants and what is technically possible, or feasible. This requires online or over-the-phone collaboration and travelling to the customer’s premises to better understand what needs to be completed and implemented.</p></li>
						<li><br><h4 class="major">Software vendor</h4>
							<p align = "justify">The suite of software programs that make up SAP are not released and then remains as-is, with minor updates for bug fixes. Instead, SAP is continually evolving, requiring constant communication between the vendor and Alistair’s company to stay up to date. Alistair works with account managers, partner managers and solution architects. Since Discovery Consulting is reliant on SAP, and not the other way around, it is up to Alistair and his colleagues to reach out to SAP. This frequently involves travel, including international travel to Singapore, the US or Europe.</p></li>
						<li><br><h4 class="major">Internal</h4>
							<p align = "justify">As a Discovery Consulting director, Alistair must interact with people across his organisation's entire breadth. He mainly works with others providing IT consultancy, who design, build, deliver and support. He also works with the company’s accountant for financial matters, the HR manager for human capital matters, and Payroll, reporting and internal IT staff to ensure the company itself is supported from an IT perspective. This occurs within the (Melbourne) office with occasional travel to the Sydney office.</p></li>
				</div>

				<h4 class="major">Where does he spend most of his time?</h4>
				<p align = "justify">Discovery Consulting’s priority is to ensure successful delivery of their IT projects, and thus most of Alistair’s time is spent with customers. While Alistair’s company will help with the ERP software implementation, the customers will be using it on a day-to-day basis and will require a knowledge of how their setup works and how to use it. Alistair will spend time with customers to ensure they understand how to do tasks and manage any issues. There are certain risks inherent with using any software to manage processes, and the clients need to know how to handle this risk, which requires Alistair's assistance. </p>

				<h4 class="major">How did he get where he is?</h4>
				<p align = "justify">Alistair started as an accountant, with a Bachelor’s degree in business and an MBA. With interest in IT, Alistair started using his accountancy background to assist with developing IT systems in Finance. He moved on from IT development to management and consulting, which led to a partnership with SAP technologies. As Alistair moved along his career bath, he learned that the most important thing is the organisation for which you work for – while money is essential, it’s vital to find a role in an organisation that is enjoyable to work at, supportive and appreciative. “You work to live, not live to work”.</p>

				<h4 class="major">What does he find challenging?</h4>
				<p align = "justify">One challenging aspect of Alistair's work is people management, interacting with those both internal and external. As part of his role, Alistair needs to interact with people of diverse backgrounds and personalities. While this can be seen as refreshing, it can also mean that there are elements of the teams he deals with that require significant time to assist, coach and manage.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Another challenging piece in his current organisation is staying up to date with developments and changes to the software used by the company, SAP. A new version is released to the market every six months. Those at Digital Consulting need to stay current or else fall behind their competition; both in the consulting space and behind those using other competitors to SAP. This is a significant investment for the organisation and at an individual level, with 5-10% of his time spent annually on professional development.</p>
				<p align = "justify">To get to where he is, Alistair has had to learn quickly. He found that he started out of his depth when performing specific roles and had to get up to speed. He mentions, however, that many roles were related or had some transferable skills.</p>


				<h4 class="major">What are his recommendations for those looking to enter the industry?</h4>
				<p align = "justify">Practical experience within the business is highly recommended for looking to enter into a business IT consulting role. Alistair considers that people with business experience and acumen are valued greatly within the professional services/ERP field. A person having a background and experience in how business works in the real world would have great insight into the processes that go on in a business. This fundamental understanding of “real business” can be applied to the IT side, enhancing this person’s abilities to manage the processes and challenges faced and credibility that the person knows what they are talking about.  </p>
