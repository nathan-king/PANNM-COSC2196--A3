				<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
				<div class="justify">
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						PANNM is developing an app that would allow the user to reduce the amount of food that goes to
						waste
						within the household. A user would scan the barcode on the food product with a smartphone as
						they
						are putting their shopping away. Defaulting to a date screen in which the use-by date is
						captured,
						generating a database within the device of the products stored in the pantry, fridge and freezer
						and
						what date they will expire.
					</p>
					<p>
						A weekly email sent to the user with the list of products set to expire over the next ten days,
						would also be visible in the App, and notifications would appear three days out, one day out and
						date of expiry. When the notification is received, the user will select one of three responses.
						<ul class="actions fit">
							<li><a class="button fit"><strong>Consumed.</strong></a></li>
							<li><a class="button fit"><strong>I'll wait a little longer.</strong></a></li>
							<li><a class="button fit"><strong>Disposed.</strong></a></li>
						</ul>
<!-- Trying alternative to below for better image on site
						<ol>
							<li>Consumed.</li>
							<li>I'll wait a little longer.</li>
							<li>Disposed.</li>
						</ol>
-->
					</p>
					<p>

					</p>
					<p>
						Once acknowledged as either consumed or disposed of, adding the item to a shopping list is
						offered, before removing the product from the date expiry list.
					</p>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>
						With over thirty years of experience in the supermarket industry, Phil is accustomed to seeing large
						amounts of food waste. Whether damaged, slow sales or use-by date expiring before it could be sold,
						or simply the quality did not meet the consumers' expectations.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the years, the industry has developed many strategies to avoid food waste, ending up in the
						landfill. Food rescue partners such as “Fairshare”, “Second Bite” or “Oz Harvest” rescue food close
						to use-by and unable to be sold, even product that may be now past use-by, though frozen before it
						expired. They also form partnerships with farmers to take green waste and day-old bread to feed to
						livestock.
					</p>
					<p>
						The real motivation is generated, knowing how much food goes to waste without even being purchased
						in the supermarkets. Let alone standing at the fridge and throwing food products in the rubbish bin
						because it has passed its use-by date before being consumed at home—just thinking of not only this
						waste of product but the waste of money along the way. We all need to play a part in this journey to
						prevent food waste, not only because of what we can see but also the environmental impact of
						producing these products.

					</div>
					<p>
						Approximately $3.5 billion in food waste is generated annually after arriving in stores and then failing to be sold. The genuinely alarming number at more than 300% higher is that over $10 billion annually in food waste after people have purchased it from the supermarket, greengrocer, butcher or corner store. At nearly 300kg per capita, Australian households discard on average between $2,200 and $2,800 worth of food every year. The environmental impact presents an even more frightening image with an average consumption of 475 litres of water per day per every Australian, simply to produce this food, then wasted. Or 7.6 tonnes of greenhouse emissions generated from the decay of one year’s worth of food waste.<a href="citations#citations-research">(Food Innovation Australia Limited 2019)</a> We all need to play a part.


					</p>

					<h2>Further Research</h2>
					<p>
						Feedback provided by Umera Imtinan was to complete further research into the proposal, as there are similar products on the market, and similar to a project completed by a previous study group. We reviewed some apps on the market that offered a similar experience with the below findings. Of the ten Applications we found, six we were unable to investigate in detail due to them not being available on the Australian market resulting in no information appearing when directed to the online stores to review. The remaining four applications all offer varying levels of functionality, that if all brought together in a single tool, would prove to be incredibly powerful.
					</p>

					<h3 class="app-heading">Fridgely App</h3>
						<span class="image left" >
							<a target="_blank" href="images/Project Research Fridgely.png"><img src="images/Project Research Fridgely.png" alt="Fridgely App Image" title="Ehlert 2015"></a>
							</span>
							<p align = "justify">
								The Fridgely application  available through the iTunes App store offers to tell you when your food will expire, offers barcode scanning and generates an estimated expiry date. It will send notifications when your food will expire and finds recipes based on the ingredients provided in your custom lists. The US-based application includes options to link in Coupons to major US retailers, though I admit a lack of knowledge in this space.<a href="citations#citations-research">(Ehlert 2015)</a>
							</p>
							<p align = "justify">
								The App is initially free and offers further options by upgrading to a premium app for $4.49, though it does not mention any time limits for this amount. The upgrade options include the ability to export shopping lists, export to CSV files and customise notifications. Although offering the ability to scan barcodes or use a receipt reader, a test within my pantry found that the scanner only recognised 25% of scanned barcodes, suggesting the linked databases are not international.
							</p>

					<h3 class="app-heading">CozZo・Food Inventory Manager</h3>
						<span class="image left" >
							<a target="_blank" href="images/Project Research Cozzo.png"><img src="images/Project Research Cozzo.png" alt="Cozzo App Image" title="COGZUM BULGARIA OOD 2017"></a></span>
							<p align = "justify">
								Cozzo  is a food expiry tracking app that offers the users the choice when first opening the App, the choice of nine different languages. The free version of the App is simplistic, either manually entering products and dates, or using flashcards to add product and dates generically. Upgrading to a subscription plan of $24.99 per year, or $2.99 per month, users can access group up to ten devices sharing lists, and activate additional features, including barcode scanner and receipt reader. Product list storage size also increases on the plans.<a href="citations#citations-research">(COGZUM BULGARIA OOD 2017)</a>
							</p>
							<p align = "justify">
									The subscription version of the application also includes the functionality to match ingredients in your list to recipes to consume products before expiry. Recipes can be imported from any website. On purchasing the App to try, despite some innovative features offered, I found it challenging to use, with the App repeatedly shutting down on the recipe page, selecting “search by stocked products” and the Developer only offering a single recipe of their own. Sell point was engagement with eCommerce websites, though I could not work out how to instigate this option.
							</p>



				<h3 class="app-heading">Expr Food Date Expiration Tracker</h3>
				<span class="image left" >
					<a target="_blank" href="images/Project Research EXPR.png"><img src="images/Project Research EXPR.png" alt="Expr Food Date Expiration Tracker Image" title="Lim 2020"></a></span>
						<p>
							The EXPR app was a project completed by a class at Next Academy in Malaysia. The App, like others, is designed to set reminders of food that is going to expire, while being able to search the web by selecting ingredients in the generated lists. While the App does not appear to offer a barcode scanner, it is incredibly intuitive, with voice engine software, to add items to the list, by providing a product and a time frame or a specific date, recording the actual date, e.g. the date in three days. The application also offers the ability to scan the expiry date and enter with the device camera. We were limited to the information available to that provided by their video on the academy website. We were unable to locate the App in any iTunes or Google store. <a href="citations#citations-research">(Lim 2020)</a>
						</p>

				<h3 class="app-heading">BEEP - Expiry Date Tracking</h3>
				<span class="image left" ><a target="_blank" href="images/Project Research Beep.png"><img src="images/Project Research Beep.png" alt="BEEP - Expiry Date Tracking" title="BGPworks 2017"></a></span>
						<p>
							This App was available through the iTunes App Store, with a one-month free subscription before being available on a tiered pricing plan. Payment options are monthly at $12.99 per month, quarterly at $32.99 per quarter, half-yearly at $55.99 per six months and annually at $89.99 per annum.  Whilst free, the App does include advertising.
						</p>
						<p>
							With a quick and responsive scan of barcodes with the option of two different scanners, I could not tell the difference. Once a product is scanned, it quickly defaults to a date enter screen with a scrolling date function, starting at the current date. The App is accessing a significant database, quickly bringing up the product scanned, including an image. If the product is not in the database, it will default for you to enter a description, and photo, before entering the expiry date. The App also can be shared within a group, allowing users within a household to add to the same list, whilst offering the ability to download the current list to an excel file. Products can be categorised into groups based on your criteria. <a href="citations#citations-research">(BGPworks 2017) </a>

				<h2>Group discussion and proposals</h2>
				<p>After completing research and identifying a couple of products similar to our proposal, the group discussed whether we should change projects or proceed by adding further enhancements. We intend to proceed with the project working to produce the App, including the below ideas generated from in-depth discussions.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Add the functionality to take an image of the use-by date, which would convert it to text to enter the date rather than complete manually by the user.</li>
					<li>
						A product listed as short-dated, the email list would include recipe suggestions that could help in consuming the product before the use-by-date expiry.
					</li>
					<li>
						When the list of the products is emailed, it would include a copy of the barcode that could be scanned by the major supermarkets' shopping apps.
					</li>
					<li>
						Review the opportunity to work with the major supermarkets to include adding to shopping list, automatically add to the lists within the supermarkets shopping apps, and reduce the need to add manually later.
					</li>
					<li>
						Review the long-term opportunity to sell the App to the major supermarkets to integrate into their existing shopping apps.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					By integrating these ideas, we believe we can build an app that initially may appear similar to others on the market, though with the correct selling techniques, will be able to include additional selling points to show this App has far more to offer.

				<h2>The Skills, Methods, and Tools and Technologies</h2>
				<p>
					Many tools and technologies that can be used to develop mobile applications. There are many types of applications used on portable devices such as mobile phones and tablets, separated into four categories: native applications, traditional web applications, advanced web applications (PWAs), and hybrid applications <a href="citations#citations-skills">('Which Is Best - Native vs. Hybrid vs. Progressive Web Apps | Lateral Solutions' 2021)</a>:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Native applications</strong> are the most desirable in performance, native functionality, offline storage and native UX/UI feel. However, they are much more costly to make than other types of apps. They require expensive maintenance, need to be approved by major distributors, and are generally not cross-platform, thus necessitating multiple applications using different languages and frameworks.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Traditional web applications</strong> are probably the least desirable for mobile platforms. The benefits of traditional web applications are that they are entirely cross-platform, cost-effective, easy to maintain, and search engine optimised. Nonetheless, they tend to be much slower than native applications, do not have a native UX/UI feel, and do not look particularly professional.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Progressive web applications</strong> are somewhat more desirable than traditional web applications. They provide many of the benefits of conventional web apps while also utilising some native features such as offline functionality, push notifications, offline storage, and access to hardware cameras calendars. On the other hand, while they address many of the application as mentioned earlier types' drawbacks, they do not give the same quality of user experience as native applications. A major pitfall of PWAs is that iOS support for them is relatively limited.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Hybrid applications</strong> are built with a web development framework contained within a native shell. Enabling developers to build a cross-platform web application while still maintaining most of the benefits of a native application such as access to device features and functionality, app-store visibility, more generous offline storage and a more native-like experience. Furthermore, the development costs are far less than for native applications due to their faster build time and the fact that they are intrinsically cross-platform. These applications' drawbacks are more unsatisfactory performance than native apps, a slightly less than native UX/UI feel, and distribution costs.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Weighing the pros and cons, the two most attractive of the above categories are probably hybrid applications and PWAs as they are cost-effective, fast to develop, yet still provide a somewhat traditional native app experience. In our particular project idea, the lack of iOS support for push notifications (which are essential to our project idea) makes hybrid applications a clear winner here.
				</p>
				<p>
					React Native, a hybrid framework based on one of the most popular web development libraries would be the right candidate for this development. It is well-maintained, has a shallow learning curve for web developers and used in many significant applications. With a developed ecosystem with many useful packages at one’s disposal—the framework is written in JavaScript, the most prevalent utilised programming languages. The develops building this application will need to have a solid knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, RESTful routing and server-side programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other than the development framework, Open Food Facts maintains an open-source database with comprehensive data on over a million food items and a public API that would allow our application to query and use it for the application's purposes. Furthermore, their website links several SDKs and wrappers to facilitate development, including one for React Native <a href="citations#citations-skills">(‘Open Food Facts Data’ 2021)</a>. Lastly, the NPM (a JavaScript package manager) provides packages that decrease the development time of certain features such as scanning barcodes <a href="citations#citations-skills">('qrcode-scanner-react-native' 2021)</a>.
				</p>

				<h2>Funding</h2>
				<p>
					As with any project, the consideration of money. How do we fund the build? How do we fund the ongoing maintenance? How do we fund security measures and data storage? What do you charge for the sale of the App? These all seem like simple questions, though for a start-up, is also a little daunting.
				</p>
				<p>
					To build a mobile App in Australia, it can cost between $50,000-$250,000+. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How Much Does It Cost to Build an App in Australia in 2020?” 2020)</a>. There are multiple factors to take into consideration when determining the costs to develop an app:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>External or Internal Development:</strong> Internal development may come at a lower cost, but if the team does not have the necessary skills, it could extend the development process. While external development may seem like it may come at a higher cost, it can be more cost-effective and offers significant advantages; a more incredible experience, flexible development process and shorter timeframe for completion <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How much does a Mobile App cost to Build?” 2020)</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>The number of platforms:</strong> Will the app be designed for use with, Apple, Android or web app? <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How Much Does It Cost to Build an App in Australia in 2020?” 2020)</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>The number of screens:</strong> Each screen will require design and development, the more screens, the higher the cost. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How Much Does It Cost to Build an App in Australia in 2020?” 2020)</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>App design/Front-end development:</strong> The design of an app can determine the success of an app. An app needs to be appealing to look at and easy to navigate. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How much does a Mobile App cost to Build?” 2020)</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Back-end development:</strong> The use of technologies (e.g. API) for communicating with your app. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How much does a Mobile App cost to Build?” 2020)</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>App Integrations:</strong> The type of integration influences cost, i.e., proprietary integration or integration to a well-documented publicly available API. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How Much Does It Cost to Build an App in Australia in 2020?” 2020)</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>The complexity of features:</strong> The more complex the feature, the higher the cost. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How Much Does It Cost to Build an App in Australia in 2020?” 2020)</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Marketing:</strong> A marketing campaign may be required to generate interest in the app. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How much does a Mobile App cost to Build?” 2020)</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Maintenance:</strong> The general cost for ongoing maintenance is about 10% to 20% of the start-up costs. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“How Much Does It Cost to Build an App in Australia in 2020?” 2020)</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Due to the high costs to start up an App, it would be best to develop a prototype app or minimum viable product (MVP). This can be created internally developed at a relatively low cost, with the app's basic features. This will allow potential investors, stakeholder and users to engage and interact with the app to provide feedback. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“App prototypes - Wave Digital App Development - Melbourne” 2020).</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					By deciding to develop a prototype, we may be eligible to receive an MVP Grant from the state government. Successful grant applicants can receive up to 50% of approved product costs (maximum of $25,000), receiving 35% up-front and 65% after completing and validating the MVP <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“Minimum Viable Product grants” 2020)</a>. To be eligible, we must meet specific criteria.
				</p>
				<p>
					Initially, the build would be completed as a project between colleagues, not necessarily requiring investment other than time and experience. However, scale-up brings additional costs, including PaaS costs to support customer databases, security and data storage, especially if we offer cloud functionality to share lists across family devices. This kind of development leans towards seeking potential corporate sponsorship in the long term; however, we would look to funding through seeking investors and ongoing with in-app advertising and subscription plans.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Free trial period funded by In-App advertising.
					</li>
					<li>
						Advertising Free subscription services of potentially $5 per month or $50 per year, though this would need to be reviewed in line with the economy scales.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Subscriptions would be managed through the respective App Stores to eliminate the needs to store and manage user confidential payment details, though this does come at a cost. Both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store charge a 30% commission for all In-App purchases, including subscriptions. However, this drops to 15% after the first year while the Galaxy Store charges 30% though this negotiable. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(Alexander 2020)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Additional Costs to consider are access costs such as Apples Developer Program, which, for the annual fee of $99US allows access to software and tools, SDKs, and distribution services, including technical support. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(“What’s Included - Apple Developer Program” 2021)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The final piece is the distribution of profits. An agreement would need to be made and agreed to by all those involved. One exact point we are consistent on, is that Open Food Facts offers an open-source to their data, and survive on donations. We believe it would be the right thing to do if utilising their data on an ongoing basis, to include a donation percentage. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(2021)</a>
				</p>

				<h2>Outcome</h2>
				<p>
					The desired results from this app's building are to support consumers everywhere with reducing food waste ultimately. Financially no person or family should need to waste money on food going in the bin, and we believe with a simple tool to use, we can make a genuine contribution to society. We believe we have a model idea that will prevent food spoilage, reduce landfill, make tangible savings to the consumers and most of all have an environmental impact on greenhouse emissions used to produce food, and compost the waste.
