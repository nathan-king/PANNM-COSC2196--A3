						<h2 class="major">Interview Transcript: Alistair Elliott – Director, Discovery Consulting.</h2>
						<div class="justify">
						<p>
						Friday 15th January 2021
						</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?  </strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									I work for an IT Consulting organisation called Discovery Consulting. The organisation
									specialises in the implementation and support of SAP software. Within the organisation I help
									customers select the correct software against their business requirements and also oversee
									implementations of the software across the various streams, such as Functional, Technical, Change and Training.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The industry we operate is classified as Professional Services. This industry is quite diverse
									in regard to the providers, as dominated by Tier one organisations, such as PWC, Deloitte, EY and
									KPMG. Our organisation sits within the tier 2 level and consists in our specialist area of ERP with
									around 15+ competitors across a number of ERP solutions. Hence, we compete with the likes of Tier 1,
									Tier 2 and the general contractor market. Our value proposition is differentiated predominately
									from our specialist, dedicated skilled consultants and from a cost base perspective, but is hence
									very reliant on continual professional development.
								</li>
								<li>
									The software we use and those of the competition is being continually updated and released to
									the market every six months. Hence, we need to ensure that we are ahead of the releases and
									able to provide our customers with knowledge of the new solutions and where possible with track
									record of doing so. The investment required both from an individual and organisation perspective,
									in terms of professional development, is significant and would take anywhere between 5-10% of
									individuals work effort through the year.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									In the consulting field We need to be extraordinarily flexible and be willing to take on
									tasks for which we may not be comfortable. This is the nature of consulting and the new world
									of IT and hence myself and my colleagues need to have the mindset to adopt to any different
									tasks as required. Our organisation is also very small, hence this can mean arrange of tasks
									required in the organisation, such as sales, pre-sales, delivery and support.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Customers:</strong> I predominately deal with the C-Level of customer organisations
									and as we are an ERP delivery team, this would include the CIO as they are generally overseeing
									an outlining the strategic plans of future IT systems, CFO as they are either planning a new
									finance system or hold the budget and CHR, for when we are performing Human Capital Management (HCM) solutions.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Vendors:</strong> Our predominant vendor is the software supplier, being SAP. I work with a range
									of people in our relationship, such as account managers, partner managers and solution architects. This
									is managed predominately here in Australia but can also require us to travel to Singapore, US or Europe.
									As their organisation is globally distributed and they have over 90,000 employees it is up to us to travel to them.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Internal:</strong> My primary interaction would be with our internal team. It is our team that
									deliver to our customers and we need to ensure that we are aligned, equipped and ready to be able to
									provide the specialist services expected.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What functions do they play in your daily routines?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Customers:</strong> Customers are our primary external interaction. Our interaction is predominately
									around the communication of their requirements/business needs and we in turn then work, hopefully in a
									collaborative sense, to put forward a solution and proposal that will solve their business requirements
									and meet their time and budgetary expectations.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Vendors:</strong> We are reliant on ASAP and their relationship with them as is the cornerstone of
									our business. We therefore Work with them continually to ensure our organisation and our individuals are
									experienced and across all certifications required to maintain our accreditation with SAP. They also assist
									with our business development for potential new customers and all projects and hence play an important role
									for the ongoing sustainability and future of our organisation.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Internal:</strong> As I interact across the entire breadth of our organisation this is quite a
									significant question, so I will simplify it as best as possible. My colleagues in the organisation for
									whom I interact perform not only a strictly IT consultant task, such as design build deliver and support,
									but also those organisational functions that are required to run an organisation. Therefore, I interact with
									our accountant for financials our HR manager for Human Capital matters our Payroll/AP Manager, Reporting
									and Analytics and our own internal IT staff to ensure our own organisation is supported for IT needs.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									My primary interaction with other IT professionals is once more based around those in the ecosystem of SAP.
									This can be quite diverse as it could be at IT conferences, customer sites running different or dependent
									software, or indeed a collaboration between different organisations and hence the IT professionals in a joint
									delivery for a customer. We also have and do different forms where we bring together senior and junior IT
									professionals so to assist in their growth. Therefore, at times I interact with IT professionals to facilitate such forums.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									I have mentioned Clients/Customers previously, so I'll look at investors, or in our case, shareholders. I am fortunate to
									be part of a shareholder group in the organisation for which I work. Therefore, we do meet with our investors on a regular
									basis which means looking at the performance of the organisation, understanding IT trends in the marketplace and then
									revisiting strategy and execution plans as required.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Customer delivery and satisfaction from a project and account management perspective. Our priority is to ensure successful
									delivery of our IT projects and hence customers need assistance to understand how to do tasks, how to manage any risks/issues
									and that would take most of my time to ensure success for both sides.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									People Management, whether that is customer, vendor or internal, people management is a necessary evil of IT and professional
									services. The diverse backgrounds and personalities can be seen as refreshing and almost job diversity experience, which it is,
									however there is always elements of the team(s) for which considerable time is required to assist, coach and manage people.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>Can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Possibly the most rewarding aspect, particularly the tasks that I do, is initially planning and designing systems that will
									save organisations time and money and operate better and then upon completion, revisiting the metrics assigned against business
									cases on how the performance has gone. For example, we have many cases, where we have assisted organisations who previously had
									vast amount of manual work and interpretations that have led to long hours and mistakes, some who have been on the front pages
									of national papers for incorrect payroll results. Hence when we have completed assisting our customers and we review the
									outcomes with our key stakeholders from our customers and they see the tangible results, so not forecasted, and they see other
									things now being achieved in their organisation from freeing up time and things being performed correctly and accurately, it is extremely satisfying.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What path led you to where you are today?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									I had commenced my career looking at working as an accountant, but along the way, found an interest in IT more attractive. I
									was very much using my Accountant background to assist with the development of IT systems in the Finance area. I then went
									from IT development to management and consulting, which has led through to long partnership alongside SAP technologies.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What qualifications did you need? </strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The role I have now has seen a Bachelor in Business and a MBA. However, I would suggest that a business background qualification,
									whether Accountancy, Human Resource Management or IT are a great steppingstone to commence into this area for which we work.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What do you need to do to ensure you stay informed about latest developments, and operating at peak form?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									I have mentioned earlier, we spend between 5-10% of our time yearly maintaining qualifications and understanding latest business
									and IT trends. In our area, particularly with some of the consultants I work with, some of this is mandatory so that they retain
									their certifications to continue working with the system.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What advice would you give to someone looking to enter your industry? </strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									In the area that I work, being professional services / ERP, those individuals with business experience and acumen are valued greatly.
									Knowing business processes and being able to effectively communicate and consult is very important.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>Can you talk to us about loyalty in the industry?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Generally, people once they are within the IT Industry do remain, however the professional services industry certainly do change. We
									find that, particularly for those working at a tier one, it can be very demanding, as can be seen from recent articles in the Financial
									Review. Hence you do see people swapping between Professional Services and Industry, but generally remain within the IT sector.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>Do you find that people in the IT Industry remain loyal to employers, or do they have a tendency to change regularly?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									I do not believe the IT Industry/sector is any different in regard to loyalty to employers than other industries. There is certainly a
									percentage that move on an annual basis but would imagine it is relatively stable.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<P>
								<strong>What did you learn from working with different employers?</strong>
							</P>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The greatest thing I learnt along my career path, is the organisation for which I wish to be working. I understand that although earning
									money is important, it is around finding a role that is satisfying in an organisation that is enjoyable to work at, supporting and
									appreciated. The old adage, your work to live, not live to work.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>How did you come about to enter the field? / How did you end up taking the current path in the IT industry?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									I have outlined this previously, but essentially through the early part of my career, understanding that my preference was
									around IT solutions and how they can solve business requirements and issues rather than straight accountancy.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>Did you work in different streams prior to your current role?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Yes, I have worked in different streams both within and outside of the industry. These have included enterprise start-ups (planning / financial),
									warehouse logistics and planning and financial planning within a CFO office.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What roadblocks did you come across?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Certainly, when performing logistics roles, I was out of my depth and had to learn quickly, however all other roles although not within the IT
									industry specifically, were relatable or transferable skills with some application.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								<strong>What recommendations would you make to someone wishing to enter the industry?</strong>
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									As I have mentioned previously, I would recommend having some real-world business experience, whether that is operating in an Accounts Payable
									area, working within a logistics operation, so to understand real world processes. This fundamental understanding of “real business” is
									important so that when it comes to working on the IT side, you bring credibility to the table in at least having an understanding of processes
									and challenges that you are looking to assist.
								</li>
							</ul>
