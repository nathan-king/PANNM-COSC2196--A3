						<p align="justify">Phil is a retail executive, from Hoppers Crossing Victoria. He has over 30
							years' experience in the supermarket industry with varying managerial roles during this time
							but is now ready for a career change. Phil lives with his partner Veronica, three children
							Tayla, Jai and Brodie, and dog Rocky. They love to get away camping three or four times a
							year, with his favourite spot being off the grid in the high--country Howqua Hills. Phil has
							always had an interest in IT, since the early days of computers; however, life got in the
							way, he is now only just following his passion. Phil works daily with Microsoft Office and
							Google Suite. He has expanded knowledge as an end-user of SAP BW, SAP R3, SAP WEBI, TM1,
							KRONOS, in financial reporting. He has also used JavaScript and SQL Developer in the past
							and recently worked on his SQL scripting skills. <a

								s3884660</a></h2>
						<p align="justify">Alasdair is back living in Perth, WA, with his fiancée and two cats, after
							growing up in a country town Capel. Working in an administrative role and studying, his free
							time is limited, but thanks to online study combined with his current role, he has the right
							amount of flexibility for it to run smoothly. However, when he does have free time you find
							him gaming, one might say he has a particular set of skills, which allow him to play no
							better than the average player. Alasdair has had an interest in IT since taking a robotics
							class in year 8. He learnt to program the behaviour of the Lego models using a program that
							graphically represented logic gates. During his later years in high school, he learnt to
							program complex games or methods on his graphics calculator for solving maths and physics
							problems. <a href="citations#citations-profile">(Cameron, 2020)</a></p>

						<p align="justify">Nathan is a British Australian living in Sydney, NSW. Over the years he lived
							in multiple countries including France, Canada and Japan and can speak French, Portuguese
							and Spanish on top of English. He has a Bachelor of Psychology but has taken the leap and is
							now working as a freelance web developer. As a child Nathan was fascinated by computers,
							spending hours discovering his first PC - a Windows 95 Dell. Nathan's main interest in IT is
							the way technology shapes our civilisation. Ever since undertaking a Udemy course on web
							development, he knew he wanted to work in and study IT in a serious capacity. While Nathan
							has experience with development and programming, he wishes to expand his understanding and
							knowledge and learn different aspects of the IT works, the science behind computer systems,
							the directions that IT is moving and more profound programming aspects. <a

						<p align="justify">Nicholas is living in Melbourne Victoria, working in sales while studying.
							While living in Australia his whole life, his mum is from the Seychelle Islands, and his dad
							is from Greece. He is currently teaching himself Mandarin and enjoys American Football.
							Although it can be painful at times, he has recently become infatuated with mountain biking.
							Nicholas has always loved games and continuously wondered how they work, ever since his
							family had their first console, a Super Nintendo. Game design is not necessarily the career
							path he desires in IT, but it sparked his interest in learning more. He aims to understand
							better IT's aspects, including computer systems, i.e., how they work, cyber-security, i.e.,
							how to prevent breaches and improve programming skills. <a
