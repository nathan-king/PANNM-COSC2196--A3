						<p align="justify">Phil is a retail executive, from Hoppers Crossing Victoria. He has over 30
							years' experience in the supermarket industry with varying managerial roles during this time
							but is now ready for a career change. Phil lives with his partner Veronica, three children
							Tayla, Jai and Brodie, and dog Rocky. They love to get away camping three or four times a
							year, with his favourite spot being off the grid in the high--country Howqua Hills. Phil has
							always had an interest in IT, since the early days of computers; however, life got in the
							way, he is now only just following his passion. Phil works daily with Microsoft Office and
							Google Suite. He has expanded knowledge as an end-user of SAP BW, SAP R3, SAP WEBI, TM1,
							KRONOS, in financial reporting. He has also used JavaScript and SQL Developer in the past
							and recently worked on his SQL scripting skills. <a

							growing up in a country town Capel. Working in an administrative role and studying, his free
							time is limited, but thanks to online study combined with his current role, he has the right
							amount of flexibility for it to run smoothly. However, when he does have free time you find
							him gaming, one might say he has a particular set of skills, which allow him to play no
							better than the average player. Alasdair has had an interest in IT since taking a robotics
							class in year 8. He learnt to program the behaviour of the Lego models using a program that
							graphically represented logic gates. During his later years in high school, he learnt to
							program complex games or methods on his graphics calculator for solving maths and physics
							problems. <a href="citations#citations-profile">(Cameron, 2020)</a></p>

							the way technology shapes our civilisation. Ever since undertaking a Udemy course on web
							development, he knew he wanted to work in and study IT in a serious capacity. While Nathan
							has experience with development and programming, he wishes to expand his understanding and
							knowledge and learn different aspects of the IT works, the science behind computer systems,
							the directions that IT is moving and more profound programming aspects. <a

							how to prevent breaches and improve programming skills. <a

					<p align="justify">Overall we believe our group worked great together. We all brought our own set of skills and knowledge, which allowed us to compliment one and others strengths and identify weaknesses. Using TEAMs, our communication lines were always open, everyone remained accountable, and no one was afraid to ask for help. We met three times a week throughout assignment two for video chats to go over our workload. However, we have now dropped this down to two meetings per week, as we have built a strong communication network and are aware of our varying work and study schedules. </p>

					<h1 class="major">Career Plans</h1>

					<h2>Phil Batten | SAP SuccessFactors Consultants</h2>
					<p align="justify">A career plan to become an SAP Software consultant has journey attached to it. The training to learn SAP is readily available online through their learning hub [<a href="https://training.sap.com/learninghub" target="_blank">https://training.sap.com/learninghub</a>] the finance stream at  [<a href="https://training.sap.com/bundle/hub078-sap-learning-hub-edition-for-finance-hub078-au/" target="_blank">https://training.sap.com/bundle/hub078-sap-learning-hub-edition-for-finance-hub078-au/</a>]. Although these studies can be completed anytime, it does need to be supported with a Finance Degree. Therefore, I enrolled in the online study through Open Universities Australia and commenced studying for a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance).</p>
					<p align="justify">As I am working full time to support my family, the study plan will take approximately six years. It has been supported with a transition to the finance team with my current employer, who is also funding the study. Once complete, I will also fund obtaining my CPA (Certified Practicing Accountant), a two-year part-time study. The plan is to become confident in this field while I complete the degree, and obtain the SAP qualifications along the way. Once complete, the goal is to utilise these qualifications to transition into SAP consultancy work to see the final trimester of my working career.</p>

					<h2>Alasdair Cameron | Software Engineer</h2>
					<p align="justify">My career path to becoming a software engineer began first my researching what education I would require to enter the industry. Across all I researched, a common element was having a formal qualification such as a bachelor‚Äôs degree. As I will be continuing to work full time while studying, online learning was the best approach to give me the flexibility I need to work and succeed at study. I aim to move from my administrative role to a general IT support role about 2 study periods into my degree, to start making networking connections and build up experience specifically in the IT sector. From there, I aim to complete my degree and find a graduate-level developer job. To continue to develop my career, I will then need to complete other courses or self-paced study to demonstrate an understanding of different relevant programming languages.</p>

					<h2>Nathan King | Senior .Net Developer</h2>
					<p align="justify">To become a .NET developer, there are numerous career paths one might undertake. One such pathway is formal education through certification in programming, a certification in information technology with an emphasis on programming, or a computer science certification. Another path is through self-study and the undertaking of informal courses. Regardless of the pathway chosen, it is required that one become proficient in at least one .NET language, such as C#, F# and Visual Basic. Secondly, it is necessary to have a firm base of knowledge in programming concepts, algorithms, design patterns, databases and data structures. Finally, as ASP.NET makes up a large part of the .NET framework, a deep understanding of server and client-size web development is usually necessary, along with JavaScript, the dominant programming language for web development its frameworks provide a considerable advantage.</p>
					<p align="justify">My plan towards becoming a .NET developer started in self-study on developing web applications in JavaScript using React. I have since started a Bachelor of Information Technology, where I intend to learn about software development on a profound level. While I do not expect to learn a lot, specifically on .NET, I will harness the knowledge garnered throughout my studies and my understanding of web development to precipitate my learning of C# and .NET development. Furthermore, I intend to start building applications using C#/.NET and creating connections within the .NET community throughout my degree.</p>

					<h2>Nicholas Mpantellis | Account Manager</h2>
					<p align="justify">Although it is not a requirement for becoming an IT account manager, the recommended way to make it into this position is by first completing a Bachelors Degree in IT. Doing this shows to employers that you understand the industry, the software, and what goes into the products you are going to be selling. Looking into job listings in this field, I have found that most reliable listings have high regard for someone with a bachelor's degree and multiple years already in the IT industry. I am currently scheduled to begin a role in a customer-facing IT role in March and hope to work there while I complete the remainder of my degree.</p>
					<p align="justify">While working full time, I will take various classes to hopefully determine the field I would like to work in, with Cybersecurity currently being the front runner. Towards the end of my degree, I will be applying for IT Account Manager positions to begin a role before graduating hopefully. I also intend to complete a post-graduate degree in my chosen field, which will allow me to have a more in-depth understanding of how certain software works and will enable me to perform far better in the role.</p>

					<h2>Michelle Watson | Financial Adviser</h2>
					<p align="justify">A Financial Adviser's career path includes completing a FASEA approved degree, followed by a professional year and passing the FASEA exam (‚ÄúNew Entrant | Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority Ltd‚Äù 2020). I am undertaking a Bachelor of Business (Financial Planning) on the approved list of degrees (FASEA Approved Courses by Higher Education Providers 2020). Therefore, upon completion of this degree, in March 2022, I can undertake my professional year. As I am already in the industry as I paraplanner, I can transition to Financial Adviser's role and complete my professional year with my current company. The professional year comprises four quarters with the FASEA Exam conducted before the 3rd Quarter(‚ÄúThe Financial Adviser Examination | FASEA‚Äù 2020). Therefore by mid-2023, I could be a fully accredited Financial Adviser.</p>
