							<h2>Alternative/Competitors</h2>
							<div class="justify">
							<p>As discussed in the previous section <a href="overview#landscape">“Layout”</a>, on page 2, our research identified ten applications available on the market internationally. Six of these applications are unavailable in the Australian market place, limiting the amount of information obtained on them. An additional four applications are available on the Australian market, all with their intricacies and areas that make them better than the others. </p>
							<p>The EXPR application was a project put together by a class at NEXT Academy in Malaysia, focusing on voice recognition interaction to record use-by dates. From the limited information we could obtain, there was no demonstration of barcode scanning or linking to any databases products; however, the ability to ascertain dates based on naming a product and stating how many dates to set the expiry was awe-inspiring. The application seemed fluid, with notifications and interaction. We have not been able to find any further information than was provided in the video on the Website for Next Academy.</p>
							<p>The Fridgely App is targeted at the US market, with connections into store coupons programs which are a robust promotional activity in their market place. Testing the application here in Australia found despite what is led to be an extensive database; products found scanned within our pantries were limited to available products popular in the US and Australian markets. When reviewed, most primarily Australian products were unknown to the database linked to this application. This would make it challenging to be successful in the Australian market place.</p>
							<p>The free version of the Cozzi application was relatively simple in its approach, and the first appearance lacked appeal. Once you created an account and opened a subscription, the tools and interaction greatly improved, including a linked store between multiple users, a better database, and notification options. This application's opportunity exists because its free version is probably too simple and has insufficient appeal to consider investing in a subscription.</p>
							<p>Beep was the fourth application we found available in the Australian market place and was an imposing tool. On review, we as a team seriously considered changing direction with this project and abandoning our plan for a Use by date tracker application. Not to be disheartened, we have pushed on, working on how we can work to have an app that has a better user experience, with a vision to not only help reduce food waste within the users household, but offer an experience that expands their horizons with diet by linking into recipes, make suggestions on how to save by changing product sizes when patterns of products being disposed of before fully consumed are identified, and ultimately working towards linking into major supermarket shopping list tools.</p>

							<h2>Draft Budget and Pricing Strategy.</h2>
							<div class="justify">
							<p>As with any project, the consideration of money. How do we fund the build? How do we fund the ongoing maintenance? How do we fund security measures and data storage? What do you charge for the sale of the app? These all seem like simple questions, though for a start-up, it is also a little daunting.<br>To build a mobile App in Australia, it can cost between $50,000-$250,000+. (“How Much Does It Cost to Build an App in Australia in 2020?” 2020). There are multiple factors to take into consideration when determining the costs to develop an app:</p>

								<p>Due to the high costs to start up an App, it would be best to develop a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP). This can be internally developed at a relatively low cost, with the apps basic features to allow potential investors, stakeholders and users to interact with the app and provide feedback. By choosing to create a prototype, we can receive an MVP grant from the state government. Successful applicants of this grant can receive up to 50% of approved product costs (maximum of $25,000).</p>
								<p>Initially, the build would be completed as a project between colleagues, not necessarily requiring investment other than time and experience. However, scale-up brings additional costs, including PaaS costs to support customer databases, security and data storage, especially if we offer cloud functionality to share lists across family devices. This kind of development leans towards seeking potential corporate sponsorship in the long term; however, we would look to funding through seeking investors and ongoing with in-app advertising and subscription plans. </p>
								<ol>
									<li>Free trial period funded by In-App advertising.</li>
									<li>Advertising Free subscription services of potentially $5 per month or $50 per year, though this would need to be reviewed in line with the economy scales.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Subscriptions would be managed through the respective App Stores to eliminate the needs to store and manage user confidential payment details, though this does come at a cost. Both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store charge a 30% commission for all In-App purchases, including subscriptions. However, this drops to 15% after the first year while the Galaxy Store charges 30% though this negotiable. <a href="citations#citations-funding">(Alexander 2020)</a></p>
