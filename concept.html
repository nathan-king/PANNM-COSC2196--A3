							<h2>Drafting Concept and Features</h2>
							<p>PANNM have worked together on this project for several weeks now. They have been steadily brining it to life from the original concept idea, brainstorming the functionality and refining the details, drafting ideas of how screens may look, through to mock up. Below outlines the team's journey to date, and the plans are moving forward.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Project Flow Chart.png" alt="" /></span>


							<p>The flow chart above represents the cyclic nature of the application we are working to bring to fruition, bu working through to loading and tracking use-by dates, alerting the user of products before they expire, allowing for consumption rather than disposal, and adding to a new shopping list to purchase and start the cycle again. </p>
							<p>In our process, the next step was to start drafting what each of the screens may look like in the USE ME NOW application. These are outlined below. The team brainstormed ideas and how each piece would best work together to draft what each of the screens may look like. While potentially not an entirely complete list as our project evolves, we can take the next steps towards development.</p>
							<h2>Screen Concepts.</h2>

							<section id="main" class="wrapper style1 spotlights">
								<!-- Title -->

								<!-- SCREEN 1 -->
								<section>
									<div class="image">
										<img src="images/screen 1.png" alt="Screen 1 | Home Screen." data-position="center center" />
									</div>
									<div class="content">
										<div class="inner">
											<h2>Screen 1 | Home Screen.</h2>
											<p align="justify">When opening the Use Me Now application, the intention is that you will be greeted with the home screen, which will have short cut buttons to each of the product lists in the applications. These will consist of default lists of Freezer, Fridge, Pantry, Medicines, Shelves, and the options to add custom lists.</p>
											<p>On the home screen, each of these lists will be colour coded depending on the products' expiry dates within the list. If all products within a list have a used by date set greater than ten days, then the icon will show green, yellow if it is less than ten days, and red if there is an expired product contained within the list. Option buttons at the bottom of the screen will be to view all items, add new products to the lists, or adjust the application's profile settings. By tapping on any of the list icons will open the list of products stored within those lists, or the user selects one of three options at the bottom of the screen.</p>
										</div>

								<!-- SCREEN 2 -->
								<section>
									<div class="image">
										<img src="images/Pscreen 2.png" alt="Screen 2 | Scanning Barcode / Entering Product" data-position="top center" />
									</div>
									<div class="content">
										<div class="inner">
											<h2>Screen 2 | Scanning Barcode / Entering Product</h2>
											<p align="justify">When the user selects the ADD button from the home screen, they will be brought to this screen, where they will be presented with three ways to enter a NEW product into the list.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>By placing the barcode of the product to be entered into the camera field on the screen, the user clicks on the blue SCAN BARCODE button to scan and enter the product details.</li>
												<li>If the barcode is damaged in any way and unable to be scanned, the user can select the green button and manually enter the barcode into the application.</li>
												<li>If the product does not have a barcode such as fresh fruit or vegetables, they can select the red button and manually search for the product to enter.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Using links to the API data base, we intend to use Open Food Facts (Open Food Facts, 2021) the application will quickly identify a product by its barcode or search functions. Open Food Facts is an international data base with over 1,627,834 products</p>

								<!-- SCREEN 3 -->
								<section>
									<div class="image">
										<img src="images/screen 3.png" alt="Screen 3 | Enter Use by date and storage location." data-position="25% 25%" /></a>
									</div>
									<div class="content">
										<div class="inner">
											<h2>Screen 3 | Enter Use by date and storage location.</h2>
											<p align="justify">Once the product has been scanned, entered or searched, it will open to a new screen. The product description as located in the Open Food Facts Data base will appear along with its size and the entered barcode.</p>
											<p>Directly below these details will be either a popup calendar or a scrolling calendar in which the expiry date of the product can be selected. The selection is the scroll list below the data to select which list you wish to add to the product such as Pantry, Fridge or Freezer.<br>Once all options have been selected, the user taps the Confirm Details at the bottom of the screen to add the product to the set list.</p>
										</div>
									</div>

								<!-- SCREEN 4 -->
								<section>
									<div class="image">
										<img src="images/screen 4.png" alt="Screen 4 | Review products by list." data-position="25% 25%" /></a>
									</div>
									<div class="content">
										<div class="inner">
											<h2>Screen 4 | Review products by list</h2>
											<p align="justify">If the user selects one of the lists or ALL items on the home page, this screen will appear, defaulting to the selected list on the front screen. The user will also easily scroll through the other lists at the top of the page.  A list of products related to the choice made above will appear ranked by use by date order showing the product description and use by date, along with a tick box option.</p>
											<p>Once the items have been selected in the list, the user can acknowledge the products with one of three options at the bottom of the screen. The choice made by the user will either keep the product on the list if asked to remind again tomorrow, else remove the product from the list completely. We will also investigate an option for an open product which shortens the life span</p>

											<h2>Screen 5 | Notifications</h2>
											<p align="justify">The Use Me Now application will provide Notification options inline with most apps including Banner, On-Screen and Notification Centre. The notifications will be able to be set in the Profile screens as to how often to be notified and will include set time frames of <p>
												<div class="box alt">
													<div class="row aln-center">

											<h2>Screen 6 | Search for Recipe Ideas</h2>
											<p align="justify">An initially a simple function to search the internet for recipes that include the products that the user selected from the list.<br>The list can be generated from any options, including ALL locations and time frames to expiry.<br>The intention is that this could generate ideas to ensure a product is consumed rather than wasted.</p>

									<div class="content">
										<div class="inner">
											<h2>Screen 7 | Usage Analysis & Recommendations</h2>
											<p align="justify">Usage screen to show your trending progress on movement from the volume of product that was disposed of versus that which was consumed. A pie chart shows how many notifications were actioned in the current week, and then a percentage contribution trend for the previous eight weeks.</p>
											<p>Further options being discussed to build on this screen and could be included in further advancements would be what percentage of the product was disposed of, this having to be linked to the to screen 4, along with recommendations for example that if a trend is detected in a particular product being disposed of, that a perhaps the user should consider buying the product in small pack size or less often.</p>

							<h2>Draft MVP and Core Functions</h2>
							<p>The development of our MVP and its core functions in the most simplistic terms produce an application that can scan a barcode and recognise that product from the linked data base. Initially, this data base may be a sample of products before connecting into the Open Food Facts API. Once the product is identified, we must first enter an expiry date and receive a notification when coming close to the use-by date.</p>
							<h2>Define Programming Language and Platforms</h2>
							<p>Our vision for the USE ME NOW application is developing a simple to use tool that consumers can quickly and easily scan the barcode of any product they are placing in their pantry or fridge, enter the use-by date and rest comfortably that they will receive a notification that the product is coming close to use by so as it can be consumed rather than wasted. They are saving the consumer money whilst benefiting the environment by preventing unnecessary waste from going into landfill.</p>
