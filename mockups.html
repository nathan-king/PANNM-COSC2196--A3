				<h2>Creating a Prototype User Experience</h2>

				<div class="justify">
					<p>The initial user interface will first be designed using a paper system – rough drawings on
						physical paper to approximate the app's pages. This gives a tangible idea of how the app will
						operate and what screens are needed to explore the features (Kacharia 2016). </p>
					<p>Once we complete the plan of what screens we will have in our app, we can begin creating
						wireframes to test functionality. We have chosen to use Figma, a collaborative graphics editor
						and prototyping tool <a href="citations#citations-progress">(“Figma: the collaborative interface
							design tool.” 2021)</a>. This will allow multiple users to work together and offers
						prototyping features to allow for interactivity in the wireframes.</p>
					<p align="justify"><span class="image right"><a href="add link to prototype" target="_blank"><img
									src="images/figma mockup.png" alt="Teams Logo"></a></span>
						While the wireframes are being created, mockups will be made of what the project screens will
						look like, as shown in Figures 23-27 in the previous section and even incredibly rough drafts as
						in Figure 31. This follows on from the paper drawings mentioned previously. Once the ideas for
						the design are finalised, we will move on to high fidelity prototyping.</p>
					<p>When we have a low fidelity working interface in Figma, we will begin to refine the graphics to a
						more professional level. This will require access to image libraries and a graphic designer's
						expertise – this is covered in the Skills and Jobs section of this report.</p>
					<p>It is important to note that the designs created in Figma, while appearing to be interactive,
						will not possess the intended application's functionality, USEMENOW. We would need to engage a
						front end developer to tie together the created user interface and the back end processes.</p>
					<p>It is crucial to find and correct mistakes at each point in user interface development while it
						is easier to fix than the next step. For example, it is easier to fix an error in the paper
						planning stage by scribbling a new piece of paper than redesigning a new high fidelity interface
						page <a href="citations#citations-progress">(Kacharia 2016)</a>. Furthermore, it is still easier
						to redesign a high fidelity interface page while even in the prototyping/mockup stage than to
						redesign the page and the front end development that goes into it and the back end tie ins. A
						bit more time invested here could save a lot of funding and time further into the project.</p>

					<h2>Development</h2>
					<h3>Front End</h3>
					<p>The recruitment of a front end developer will now be required to bring all the plans and mock-ups
						to life. A detailed job description is being developed and will require advertising. Funding
						will need to be included to cover the costs of this investment. This development will require a
						friendly user experience leaving the consumers wanting to use the application.</p>
					<h3>Back End</h3>
					<p>The recruitment of a backend developer will be required to bring the technologies together to
						ensure the application works smoothly and provides the user experience as promised on the
						landing page. The ability to link the products into the Open Food Facts API, storage of use-by
						dates, notifications generated from that storage, and the ability to form family accounts
						connecting the information over the internet to other IoT devices belonging to members of the
						household.</p>
					<h3>Developer Contracts. </h3>
					<p>Both the Front End and Back End Developers need to be bound by a contract to protect us as a
						group and our idea. The contract should ensure that our intellectual property is protected. The
						developed source code remains the property of our project group, and payment costs, time frames
						and delay penalties, along with the full specifications required to be completed in their
						tenure, are clearly articulated. Naturally, the contract should also ensure permissions are
						included for any data access rights and the project idea's protection and confidentiality. <a
							href="citations#citations-progress">(“Legal123 Pty Ltd” 2021)</a></>
					<h3>Test MVP (Minimum Viable Product).</h3>
					<p>Once we have created an MVP using React Native with mock data and limited functionality. We would
						then use a testing framework such as Jest to ensure that the UI's logic is correct, test
						numerous scenarios that emulate a user, and detect bugs (this would save many person-hours).
						After this, we would use Jest to create a mock Firebase React Native database and test how the
						application fetches and processes it. We would then start adding more and more features, testing
						with Jest along the way and then connect the App to Firebase React Native for further testing.
					</p>
					<p>Functional and design features that are not filtered out by the Jest testing process will be
						presented to a small group of individuals of diverse demographics and rated to ascertain which
						parts should be abandoned and which should be further developed. </p>
					<h3>Roles</h3>
					<p>Throughout this project, our team have not had consistent and clearly defined roles. However,
						along the process, team members have undertaken tasks that are akin to those that would be taken
						by front-end web developers, user interface/experience designers, financial managers, project
						managers, and market researchers. Most of these tasks have been performed by each team member
						throughout the project. No particular roles were set was to give each team member some hands-on
						experience in the different aspects of the development stage. Furthermore, switching roles and
						undertaking new tasks helped to maintain motivation within the group.</p>
					<p>For information on the recruitment for these roles refer to the job descriptions page for
						deatils.<br>
