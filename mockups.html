							<h2>Creating a Prototype User Experience</h2>

							<div class="justify">
							<p>The initial user interface will first be designed using a paper system – rough drawings on physical paper to approximate the app's pages. This gives a tangible idea of how the app will operate and what screens are needed to explore the features (Kacharia 2016). </p>
							<p>Once we complete the plan of what screens we will have in our app, we can begin creating wireframes to test functionality. We have chosen to use Figma, a collaborative graphics editor and prototyping tool <a href="citations#citations-progress">(“Figma: the collaborative interface design tool.” 2021)</a>. This will allow multiple users to work together and offers prototyping features to allow for interactivity in the wireframes.</p>
							<p align = "justify"><span class="image right"><a href="add link to prototype" target="_blank"><img src="images/figma mockup.png" alt="Teams Logo"></a></span>
								While the wireframes are being created, mockups will be made of what the project screens will look like, as shown in Figures 23-27 in the previous section and even incredibly rough drafts as in Figure 31. This follows on from the paper drawings mentioned previously. Once the ideas for the design are finalised, we will move on to high fidelity prototyping.</p>
								<p>When we have a low fidelity working interface in Figma, we will begin to refine the graphics to a more professional level. This will require access to image libraries and a graphic designer's expertise – this is covered in the Skills and Jobs section of this report.</p>
								<p>It is important to note that the designs created in Figma, while appearing to be interactive, will not possess the intended application's functionality, USEMENOW. We would need to engage a front end developer to tie together the created user interface and the back end processes.</p>
								<p>It is crucial to find and correct mistakes at each point in user interface development while it is easier to fix than the next step. For example, it is easier to fix an error in the paper planning stage by scribbling a new piece of paper than redesigning a new high fidelity interface page <a href="citations#citations-progress">(Kacharia 2016)</a>. Furthermore, it is still easier to redesign a high fidelity interface page while even in the prototyping/mockup stage than to redesign the page and the front end development that goes into it and the back end tie ins. A bit more time invested here could save a lot of funding and time further into the project.</p><br>

								<h2>Development</h2>
								<h3>Front End</h3>
								<p>The recruitment of a front end developer will now be required to bring all the plans and mock-ups to life. A detailed job description is being developed and will require advertising. Funding will need to be included to cover the costs of this investment. This development will require a friendly user experience leaving the consumers wanting to use the application.</p>
								<h3>Back End</h3>
								<p>The recruitment of a backend developer will be required to bring the technologies together to ensure the application works smoothly and provides the user experience as promised on the landing page. The ability to link the products into the Open Food Facts API, storage of use-by dates, notifications generated from that storage, and the ability to form family accounts connecting the information over the internet to other IoT devices belonging to members of the household.</p>
								<h3>Developer Contracts. </h3>
								<p>Both the Front End and Back End Developers need to be bound by a contract to protect us as a group and our idea. The contract should ensure that our intellectual property is protected. The developed source code remains the property of our project group, and payment costs, time frames and delay penalties, along with the full specifications required to be completed in their tenure, are clearly articulated. Naturally, the contract should also ensure permissions are included for any data access rights and the project idea's protection and confidentiality. <a href="citations#citations-progress">(“Legal123 Pty Ltd” 2021)</a></>
