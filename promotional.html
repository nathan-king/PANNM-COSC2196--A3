								<h2>Promotional Activity & Landing Page: Build, Test and Launch.</h2>
								<p>Once mock-ups have been completed, including user interface and user experience defined, we will commence constructing a landing page to advertise our product, including images from the mock-up. This page will need to clearly land the message on the benefits of the application that distinguish it from others on the market, which will leave consumers wanting to purchase the USE ME NOW application.</p>
								<h3>Register</h3>
								<p>Although registering a  new app with either Apple or Google is relatively simple through the respective developer programs, there are many legal considerations to bear as part of the process to protect PANNM in the future. The app will need to include terms and conditions, which should be visible and acknowledges as part of the download process. It should also have both a privacy policy and Ende User Licence Agreement, making it clear to purchasers what they are receiving for their money. <a href="citations#citations-progress">(“Legal123 Pty Ltd” 2021)</a></p>
								<h3>Approval</h3>
								<p>Once all the legalities are sorted, we will seek approval from app stores to sell our USE ME NOW Application.</p>
								<h3>Improve | User Feedback & Addressing Issues</h3>
								<p>As soon as the application moves into testing mode, feedback should be sort from users. Regular feedback should also be sorted by including a feedback option built within the application and the available survey on the website. The key is to ensure that we respond to survey responses and take action, else credibility will be lost, and the application's reputation will be tarnished, creating brand damage.</p>

								<h3>Marketing</h3>
								<p>Recruit and contract a marketing manager to oversee the launch and all advertising specifics required to make the USE ME NOW Application successful. The contract should include specifics around the time frame, expenditure, and outcomes of the engagement.</p>
								<p>For information on the recruitment for these roles refer to the job descriptions page for deatils.<br>
