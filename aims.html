							<h1 class="major">Project Aims</h1>

							<div class="justify">
							<p>This project aims to fill a gap in the market by providing an application that enables users to accurately track their products' expiration and use-by dates to encourage a healthier and more eco-friendly lifestyle. To fulfil this aim, multiple major and minor goals have been set throughout the project's development. These goals consist of the conceptualisation, research, design, promotion and development of the product. If things do not go as expected, these will be prioritised by their level of importance:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>The first primary goal is the development of the concept. This goal consists of drafting an idea, defining the programming language, framework and platform to use, the core features of the application, and drafting a minimal viable product. This step also consists of devising a team to undertake development. This is one of the essential parts of the process as a product can be developed out of nothing.<br></li>
								<li>The second primary goal is researching the product. This goal consists of researching competitors, alternatives and potential users to clarify the product's viability, possible features and ways to fulfil a need in the market. It also consists of estimating the cost and developing a budget based on what is already on the market. This is an integral part of the process as researching will enable effective marketing of the product and ensure it is viable.<br></li>
								<li>The next goal is to create the design of the product. This stage would also consist of hiring a graphic designer and generating design proposals. This also consists of creating an interactive representation of the product to have an idea of what user interface designs work for the product, find any user experience issues associated, and provide a proof of concept. This is a relatively necessary part of the process but is not the most important as the app's more important aspects are in its functionality. <br></li>
								<li>The fourth primary goal is to promote the product. This would consist of developing a landing page for the product, testing the page, and launching it. This page will provide information on the product to come, include visual depictions of the future product, contain a survey for input on desired features, and an option to subscribe for developments. This is probably the least important part of the process as the product will be marketed at launch. Nonetheless, it is advantageous to give the app early exposure and allow target user input during the development phase.<br></li>
								<li>The fifth goal is to develop the front-end and backends of the application. For the front-end, this includes writing the code for the layout, navigation of the application, and applying graphics and animations to the product. The backend development includes building/establishing the database, organising storage for the application, creating a user authentication and authorisation system, and finding storage for the application. For both, this will include testing and debugging the application, refining the user interface and features, and then testing the minimal viable product. Again, one of the most critical aspects of the process as an app cannot exist if it has not been developed.<br></li>
								<li>The sixth goal is launching the application. This includes getting approval for releasing the application, registering the application with app stores and licensing, launching the app stores, and then marketing it. This is also one of the most critical aspects of the process as there is no point in developing an app if it is not going to be used.<br></li>
								<li>The last goal is improving the product. This will include taking input from users, collecting and interpreting application analytics, and fixing issues as they arise. Continuous testing will help to improve the product fluidly and progressively throughout the applicationâ€™s development. This is a necessary part of the process but can be done at any point of the process and does not have a definitive end date, so its importance at any given moment is relatively low. It is essential to improve the application to ensure that users continue to use the product.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>While the app's fundamental aim is to develop something that enables consumers to keep better track of their food, there are many other goals throughout the app's development. While almost all of these goals are essential, they all vary in terms of importance with goals such as software development and the app's concept being among the most essential. The promotion of the product is among the least important. Nonetheless, though importance does vary, none of the goals is redundant, and each contributes to a successful product's execution.</p><br>
