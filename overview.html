							<h2>User-by Date Tracker Application</h2>
							<p>PANNM is developing an application that will allow the user to reduce the amount of food that goes to waste in their household. Creating both a financial benefit to the user and an environmental service by reducing food waste volume will impacting wasted resources and the ozone. With a simple to use tool that allows a user to enter the use-by date of grocery and perishable products quickly, the user will then be notified on time that one or more of the products they have in the house is going to expire in the coming days, allowing for planned consumption and reduced waste. The use will then acknowledge the notification in one of three ways.</p>
							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row aln-center">
									<div class="col-4">
										<span class="image fit" ><a class="button-green fit" ><strong>Product Already Consumed.</strong></a></span>
									</div>
									<div class="col-4">
										<span class="image fit" ><a class="button-orange fit" ><strong>Remind Me Again Tomorrow.</strong></a></span>
									</div>
									<div class="col-4">
										<span class="image fit" ><a class="button-red fit" background-color = "red"><strong>Product Disposed.</strong></a></span>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>Once the products and their use-by dates have been entered, the user will receive a list at the start of the week detailing all products that will go out of date in the next ten days, allowing menus to be planned to consume the products in time. The application will also send reminders at three days or less of any products still not marked as consumed. Additional tools will allow for recipe searches that can use the products requiring consumption, where the products are stored, and tracking the benefits obtained using the application. This will also allow for suggestions on purchasing habits if products are always reaching use-by dates, such as suggesting purchasing smaller pack sizes.</p>
							<h2>Motivation</h2>
							<p>With farmers battling every day to meet fussier and fussier customer expectations and food not being sold due to natural blemishes caused by weather, it is heartwrenching to see the volume of food goes to waste even before it makes it to the markets. Then there is the volume wasted once it hits the supermarkets and greengrocers, being thrown out before being purchased.  These concerns are exacerbated further once consumers products and dispose of them before they can be eaten. Whilst the supermarkets and greengrocers have processes in place to monitor dates and implement actions to reduce the risk, such as food rescue programs “Second Bite”, “Oz Harvest”, and “Fairshare”, there are few options for the consumer once the product is at home.</p>

							<span class="image fit"><a href="citations#citations-profile"><img src="images/Plowing Crops.png" alt="" /></a></span>

							<p>Approximately $3.5 billion in food waste is generated annually after arriving in stores and then failing to be sold. Even more alarming, at 300% higher than that, is the over $10 billion in food waste annually after people have purchased it from the supermarket, greengrocer, butcher or corner store. At nearly 300kg per capita, Australian households discard on average between $2,200 and $2,800 worth of food every year. The environmental impact presents an even more frightening image with an average consumption of 475 litres of water per day per every Australian, simply to produce this food, then wasted. Or 7.6 tonnes of greenhouse emissions generated from the decay of one year’s worth of food waste. <a href="citations#citations-motivation">(Food Innovation Australia Limited 2019)</a> We all need to play a part.</p>

							<p>The Australian Government contracted Food Innovation Australia Limited to form a strategy on halving Australias Food Waste by 2030. In doing so identified while all parts of the industry have a role to play, one-third of all food waste is generated by Australian households. (Food Innovation Australia Limited 2019) With the modern-day love affair with mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, it only seems natural that one weapon that can be added to the arsenal in this war against food waste is an application that can assist consumers in consuming food rather than contributing to food waste. PANNM’s plan for a Use by Date Tracker Application is our contribution to this arsenal.</p>

							<h2 section id="landscape">Landscape</h2>
							<p>While there are over 1.85 million applications available to the estimated 3.5m smartphone users worldwide <a href="citations#citations-research">(“App Download and Usage Statistics (2020)” 2017)</a>, our research found only ten applications similar to our proposed Use by Date Tracker application.  Six of these applications are unavailable in the Australian market, and therefore little detail is available. We were able to identify four other applications, three of which are readily available on the Australian market, and the last a project by students at Next Academy in Malaysia. There is little marketing detail available. This is a perfect opportunity for another application to enter the arena. We have included further information below on each of these rival applications.  </p>

							<p><span class="image right" ><a target="_blank" href="images/Project Research Fridgely.png"><img src="images/Project Research Fridgely.png" alt="Fridgely App Image" title="Ehlert 2015" width="200"></a></span>
							<strong>Fridgely App. </strong><a href="citations#citations-research">(Ehlert 2015)</a><br>The Fridgely application available through the iTunes App store offers to tell you when your food will expire, offers barcode scanning and generates an estimated expiry date. It will send notifications when your food will expire and finds recipes based on the ingredients provided in your custom lists. The US-based application includes options to link in Coupons to major US retailers, though I admit a lack of knowledge in this space. </p>
							<p>The app is initially free and offers further options by upgrading to a premium app for $4.49, though it does not mention any time limits for this amount. The upgrade options include the ability to export shopping lists, export to CSV files and customise notifications. Although offering the ability to scan barcodes or use a receipt reader, a test within my pantry found that the scanner only recognised 25% of scanned barcodes, suggesting the linked databases are not international.</p>

							<p><span class="image right" ><a target="_blank" href="images/Project Research Cozzo.png"><img src="images/Project Research Cozzo.png" alt="Cozzo App Image" title="COGZUM BULGARIA OOD 2017" width="200"></a></span>
							<strong>CozZo・Food Inventory Manager. </strong><a href="citations#citations-research">(COGZUM BULGARIA OOD 2017)</a><br>Cozzo is a food expiry tracking app that offers the users the choice when first opening the app, the choice of nine different languages. The free version of the app is simplistic, either manually entering products and dates or using flashcards to add product and dates generically. Upgrading to a subscription plan of $24.99 per year, or $2.99 per month, users can access group up to ten devices sharing lists and activate additional features, including barcode scanner and receipt reader. Product list storage size also increases on the plans.</p>
							<p>The subscription version of the application also includes the functionality to match ingredients in your list to recipes to consume products before expiry. Recipes can be imported from any website. On purchasing the app to try, despite some innovative features offered, I found it challenging to use, with the app repeatedly shutting down on the recipe page, selecting “search by stocked products”, and the Developer only offering a single recipe of their own. The selling point was engagement with eCommerce websites, though I could not work out how to instigate this option.</p>

							<p><span class="image right" ><a target="_blank" href="images/Project Research EXPR.png"><img src="images/Project Research EXPR.png" alt="Expr Food Date Expiration Tracker Image" title="Lim 2020" width="200"></a></span>
							<strong>Expr Food Date Expiration Tracker. </strong><a href="citations#citations-research">(BGPworks 2017) </a><br>The EXPR app was a project completed by a class at Next Academy in Malaysia. Like others, the app is designed to set reminders of food that will expire while searching the web by selecting ingredients in the generated lists. While the app does not appear to offer a barcode scanner, it is incredibly intuitive, with voice engine software, to add items to the list by providing a product and a time frame or a specific date, recording the actual date, e.g. the date in three days. The application also offers the ability to scan the expiry date and enter it with the device camera. We were limited to the information available to that provided by their video on the academy website. We were unable to locate the app in any iTunes or Google store.</p>

							<p><span class="image right" ><a target="_blank" href="images/Project Research Beep.png"><img src="images/Project Research Beep.png" alt="BEEP - Expiry Date Tracking" title="BGPworks 2017" width="200"></a></span>
							<strong>BEEP - Expiry Date Tracking. </strong><br>This app was available through the iTunes App Store, with a one-month free subscription before being available on a tiered pricing plan. Payment options are monthly at $12.99 per month, quarterly at $32.99 per Quarter, half-yearly at $55.99 per six months and annually at $89.99 per annum.  Whilst free, the app does include advertising.</p>
							<p>With a quick and responsive scan of barcodes with the option of two different scanners, I could not tell the difference. Once a product is scanned, it quickly defaults to a date enter screen with a scrolling date function, starting at the current date. The app is accessing a significant database, quickly bringing up the product scanned, including an image. If the product is not in the database, it will default for you to enter a description, and photo, before entering the expiry date. The app also can be shared within a group, allowing users within a household to add to the same list whilst offering the ability to download the current list to an excel file. Products can be categorised into groups based on your criteria. </p>

							<p>The other six applications we identified are listed below; however, little information is available due to not being available in the Australian market.</p>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Project Research Non Australian Apps.png" alt="" /></span><br>

							<p>Completing the research and identifying similar products to our proposal, the group discussed how to proceed and agreed that we would have a viable product worthy or entering the market place by adding further enhancements. We intend to proceed with the project to consider the integration of the below ideas.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Text reader functionality to take an image of the use-by date, which would convert it to text to enter the date.</li>
								<li>A product listed as short-dated can search for recipe suggestions that could help in consuming the product before the use-by-date expiry.</li>
								<li>The short-dated product list emailed would include a barcode that the major supermarkets' shopping apps could scan.</li>
								<li>•	Review the opportunity to work with the major supermarkets to include adding to shopping list, automatically add to the lists within the supermarkets shopping apps, and reduce the need to add manually later along with the long-term opportunity to sell the app to the major supermarkets to integrate into their existing shopping apps.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>By integrating these ideas, we can build an app to include additional selling points to show this app has far more to offer.</p><br>
