							<h1 class="major">Risks</h1>

							<div class="justify">
							<p>We have identified several risks associated with this project. Those specific to this project have been put into three categories: Technical, Operational and External.</p>
							<H2>Technical:</H2>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li><strong>Too many users – Online functions fail <a href="citations#citations-risks">(Stangarone 2013)</a></strong><br>
								Online features can fail to respond when hit by a spike of traffic. This traffic can be caused maliciously, by bad actors targeting a specific service with a DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, or unintentionally due to unexpected demand. Our project can be vulnerable to this due to its reliance on online features, such as the Open Food Facts Database referenced in Tools & Technologies.</li>
								<li><strong>Product failure – it doesn’t work on a certain model of phone (or all phones)</strong><br>
								With the numerous available devices in the market, particularly on the Android side, there is a risk of running into a hardware/software combination that isn’t compatible with our app. This can be mitigated by closely following design conventions for the respective operating systems. Testing on several different phones is also essential to make sure that the app operates and appears the same across various devices.</li>
								<li><strong>Database compromised with inaccurate entries</strong><br>
								Without any validation and relying on open source databases, it is possible for corruption to creep into the database due to deliberate false entries or errors made when submitting information. This can be mitigated with validation and manual review, however manual reviewing would add to the cost of operating the project.</li>
							</ul><br>

							<H2>Operational:</H2>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li><strong>Lack of demand – Unable to make back the initial budget, poor marketing.</strong><br>
								Without a sufficient userbase, the risk exists that the project will not earn back the money that is spent on initial development, or the money required to maintain it on an ongoing basis.</li>
								<li><strong>Over promise/under deliver – App doesn’t ship with all the features advertised or that the user expects.</strong><br>
								Care must be taken that the app performs to advertised specifications; otherwise, there is a risk of negative marketing, as happened recently with another program, Cyperpunk 2077 <a href="citations#citations-risks">(Frank 2020)</a>. If the users feel they have been misled, this will reflect the project's review scores and discourage other users from downloading.</li>
								<li><strong>Denied by app stores (Google, iOS) <a href="citations#citations-risks">(Stangarone 2013)</a></strong><br>
								Google and Apple have specific requirements for an application to be made available on their stores, and separate approval processes. If the application is not approved on either of these platforms, this will essentially render that platform unreachable to this project; Apple does not allow sideloading (downloading from other sources). Android devices require some overrides to do so, which your average user will not attempt.</li>
								<li><strong>Hacking – Malicious parties gain access to camera/gallery/database via app </strong><br>
								Cybersecurity is an ever-growing threat and a risk to our project. Given that we will be accessing the user’s camera, we must be extra mindful that we do not have any data leakage <a href="citations#citations-risks">(Raphael 2020)</a>. Furthermore, we must ensure that all user data is secured and all passwords are stored correctly to avoid any Ashley Madison-esque incidents <a href="citations#citations-risks">(BBC News 2016)</a>.</li>
							</ul><br>

							<H2>External:</H2>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li><strong>Legal issues – not being warned about food going off, people eating spoiled food, unnecessary disposal of good food</strong><br>
								Any enterprise has its share of legal exposure. Risks specific to our project are to do with food and the dangers of relying on our product to know what is or is not spoiled. If a user were to consume expired food relying on this project’s advice, they could potentially seek legal remedy. </li>
								<li><strong>Competition – A better-funded organisation releases a competing product</strong><br>
								There is a risk of outside competition coming in with more funding and releasing a competing product. With superior marketing reach, if this competition came in too soon, it would quickly consume all market share and increase the difficulty for our application to have reach.</li>
							</ul><br>
