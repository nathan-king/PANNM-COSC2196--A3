				<h1 class="major">Machine Learning</h1>
				<span class="image fit"><a href="https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/machine-learning.html"target="_blank"><img src="images/Technologies Machine Learning.png" alt="" /></a></span>
				<h2 class="major">What is it?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">Have you ever wondered how Google always knows how to finish your search requests? Or when Gmail accurately predicts the rest of the sentence that you are typing before you do? How can tools such as Excel and Google Sheets predict which formula you want to write? These are all primary forms of machine learning. If it is possible to store the data, your behavioural history electronically, it is possible for the data to be entered into machine learning algorithms'.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Geoffrey Hinton commonly referred to as the father of deep learning first invented machine learning in 1986. The principal was simple enough, basically searching for patterns in the data, and then applying it. <a href="citations#citations-machine">(Hao 2018)</a> Similarly, as Google knows what you are about to write, or Netflix knows what type of movies you like, they have identified the pattern based on your previous search history and writing styles. The platforms you are using are tracing your patterns and learning from them, whether it is Google, Twitter, Facebook or hundreds of other platforms used every day. This is the basis of early stages of Artificial Intelligence or AI.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Deep learning is where this ability is amplified, so even the smallest patterns can be identified, referred to as “deep learning” due to the many layers of computational nodes used to search through the data, delivering its results. <a href="citations#citations-machine">(Hao 2018)</a>. Hinton was ahead of his time with this form of machine learning, and it was not until c2012 that the concept started to take off again.</p>
				<p align = "justify">The learning concepts utilised can be broken down into two main categories, though it is more complicated than in the details</p>
				<ol type="1">
					<li align = "justify"><strong>Supervised Learning</strong> is where guidance provides what type of patterns you are looking for within the data. Broken into two categories, classification techniques to predict discrete responses and regression techniques to predict continuous responses. <a href="citations#citations-machine">("What Is Machine Learning? | How It Works, Techniques & Applications" 2021)</a> Think of a police drug dog – it knows what it is looking for and keeps looking until it finds it.</li>
					<li align = "justify"><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong> is where the data has no conventional form of labelling to assist in sorting. This form of machine learning will continue to search through the data until it finds any pattern to start clustering the results to form a prediction.</li>
				</ol>
				<p align = "justify">Machine learning is the basis of Artificial Intelligence. The ability to learn from repetitive behaviour or identifying patterns within a data set to make a predictive decision successfully. While it has been around since the late eighties, the ability to apply complex mathematical calculations automatically to large amounts of data (big data) is still relatively new.  <a href="citations#citations-machine">("Machine Learning: What it is and why it matters" 2020)</a>.</p> 
				<p align = "justify">Popularly known examples of this form of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are items such as Googles self-driving cars, Fraud detection protocols used by banks such as FALCON and online recommendations such as what movie to watch on Netflix.  Use the flow chart in the Figure below to identify what is Artificial Intelligence.</p><br>
				<span class="image fit"><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/10/139137/is-this-ai-we-drew-you-a-flowchart-to-work-it-out/"target="_blank"><img src="images/Technologies What is AI Flow Chart.png" alt="" /></a></span><br>
				<h2 class="major">What is the likely impact?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">There will be various forms of impact on society due to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Even though it still be in its infancy with significant developments in the last five years, we see the impact in our everyday lives.</p>
				<p align = "justify">When we think of fully automated transportation, we automatically think of self-driving cars, though the development in this area is still potentially further away than we anticipate. How do you program a vehicle that if it will crash too one of two different people, which one does it choose? The aviation industry’s Autopilot and Flight Management Systems are both examples of machine learning and artificial. We may also see the use of machine learning in our everyday lives in the form of environmental protection where the use of the data to predict future climate and pollution impacts, or in-home security or automation with the help of facial recognition or automatically calling for emergency assistance in the event of types of alarms.</p>
				<p align = "justify">The two most significant impacts we see on our daily lives in recent times is the use of digital personal assistants such as Google or Alexa, or predictive suggestions on movies you want to watch, or websites you want to visit. However, it is hard to avoid the fear in much of the community that the development of machine learning and AI will lead to the loss of employment as it takes on tasks previously completed manually, weather forecasting, reporting, or even ordering. Supermarkets have been using automated ordering systems based on Machine Learning since the early 1990s and jobs evolved. The order writer position made redundant, and a new role created maintaining the Perpetual Inventory (PI) accuracy that the machine learning uses to base its ordering predictions. The key to success is the possibility of the machines evolving and our ability to grow and develop alongside it.</p>
				<blockquote align = "justify">"We are currently preparing students for jobs that don't yet exist … using technologies that haven't been invented … in order to solve problems we don't even know are problems yet."—Richard Riley, former Secretary of Education <a href="citations#citations-machine">("Preparing Students for Jobs That Don't Exist Yet" 2017)</a></blockquote><br>
				<h2 class="major">How will this affect you?</h2>
				<p align = "justify">Personally, in my current role as a commercial analyst, the need to develop and upskill in different forms of analysis, using other platforms and learning different skills such as learning SQL has never been greater. As more and more of my daily workload is automated, predominantly reporting, it allows the shift in focus from writing reports to analysing them, identifying opportunities and creating more work. It is one of those great fears that as I automate more and more reports, I will ultimately put myself out of a job, or do I take the opportunity to show this is the future, and create a new role to aspire to within the evolution. It is incredible how many times we interact with machine learning in my daily life, making it nearly impossible to avoid. While Google Assistant and Alexa are familiar in our lives, others appear less obvious, such as the GPS in your car, predicting words in your text, or what movie you may like to watch on Netflix, and interests on Facebook. Machine learning is working its way into our daily lives, whether you realise it or not.</p>
				<p align = "justify">Society has two options in responding to this evolution, accept or reject, and the decisions that people make to grow and evolve will reflect on their future within the world. I have worked in supermarket management for thirty-five years, and last year, I decided that it was something I could not do for another twenty until I retire. Though the food industry is essentially drought-proof, people have to eat; I changed, I moved into Finance. I have returned to study for the first time in thirty years at University and have developed more skills in the last eighteen months than I have in the previous ten years. The future is yours to manage, and how you accept these developments will be the difference between success and failure. Learning about IT, machine learning, AI and robotics will be the difference in my career.</p>
